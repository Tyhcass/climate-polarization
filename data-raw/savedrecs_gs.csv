Relying on Eurobarometer data from 28 EU member states, we systematically compare the public's belief in and salience of climate change, examining variation across the EU using Bayesian multilevel analysis. We find high levels of belief but low levels of salience in most countries. Salience varies substantially between countries and is positively related to country wealth. Levels of greenhouse gas emissions appear to have a negative relationship with both belief and salience, and individuals' political orientation has more influence on climate opinion (particularly salience) in richer countries than in poorer countries. Overall, our findings suggest that belief and salience are distinct dimensions, and that country context influences salience more than belief.","[Crawley, Sam] Victoria Univ Wellington, Polit Sci & Int Relat Program, POB 600, Wellington 6140, New Zealand; [Coffe, Hilde] Univ Bath, Dept Polit Languages & Int Studies, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Chapman, Ralph] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Geog Environm & Earth Sci, POB 600, Wellington 6140, New Zealand",Victoria University Wellington; University of Bath; Victoria University Wellington,"Crawley, S (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Polit Sci & Int Relat Program, POB 600, Wellington 6140, New Zealand.",sam.crawley@vuw.ac.nz; H.R.Coffe@bath.ac.uk; ralph.chapman@vuw.ac.nz,,"Crawley, Sam/0000-0002-7847-0411",,,,,58,5,5,3,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0303-8300,1573-0921,,SOC INDIC RES,Soc.

Yet public opinion on climate change is complex, with individuals differing on three key opinion dimensions: belief and concern, issue salience, and support for government action. In this study, we investigate how these dimensions intersect at the individual level. Based on data from an online survey conducted in 2018 in the United Kingdom (N = 787), a latent class analysis reveals that there are five climate change opinion publics. The two largest publics have strong beliefs that climate change is occurring, but view it as a low salience issue, or are wary of government action to address it. We also investigate sociopolitical covariates of each public. By providing a detailed picture of climate change views, these findings can help us to better understand the relationship between public opinion and climate policy.","[Crawley, Sam] Victoria Univ Wellington, Polit Sci & Int Relat Program, POB 600, Wellington 6140, New Zealand; [Coffe, Hilde] Univ Bath, Dept Polit Languages & Int Studies, Bath, Avon, England; [Chapman, Ralph] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Geog Environm & Earth Sci, Wellington, New Zealand",Victoria University Wellington; University of Bath; Victoria University Wellington,"Crawley, S (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Polit Sci & Int Relat Program, POB 600, Wellington 6140, New Zealand.",sam.crawley@vuw.ac.nz,,"Crawley, Sam/0000-0002-7847-0411",Victoria University of Wellington [218266],Victoria University of Wellington,This work was supported by Victoria University of Wellington [grant number 218266].,,64,22,23,10,68,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1369-1481,1467-856X,,BRIT J POLIT INT REL,Br.

Although renewable energy has potentially broader acceptance than anthropogenic climate change, it can also face differently-based opposition. Analyses of US and regional surveys, including time series of repeated surveys in New Hampshire (2010-2018) and northeast Oregon (2011-2018), explore the social bases and trends of public views on both issues. Political divisions are prominent, although somewhat greater regarding climate change due to substantive differences and more partisan opposition. Regarding climate change and to a lesser extent renewable energy, political divisions tends to widen with education. There also are robust age and temporal effects: younger adults more often prioritize renewable energy development, and agree with scientists on the reality of anthropogenic climate change (ACC). Across all age groups and both regional series, support for renewable energy and recognition of ACC have been gradually rising. Contrary to widespread speculation, these trends have not visibly responded to events such as the US hurricanes of 2012, 2017 or 2018. Together with age-cohort replacement and the potential for changes in age-group voting participation, however, the gradual trends suggest that public pressure for action on these issues could grow.","[Hamilton, Lawrence C.] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Sociol, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Hartter, Joel] Univ Colorado, Environm Studies Program, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Bell, Erin] Univ New Hampshire, Civil & Environm Engn, Durham, NH 03824 USA",University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire,"Hamilton, LC (corresponding author), Univ New Hampshire, Dept Sociol, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",Lawrence.Hamilton@unh.edu,,"Santini-Bell, Erin/0000-0002-9474-4937; Hamilton, Lawrence/0000-0003-1977-0649","National Science Foundation (The Living Bridge) [IIP-1230460, 1430260]; National Science Foundation (New Hampshire EPSCoR) [EPS-1101245]; Carsey School of Public Policy; Sustainability Institute at University of New Hampshire; Agricultural and Food Research Initiative, U.S. Department of Agriculture [2014-68002-21782, 2010-67023-21705]; Neil and Louise Tillotson Fund of the New Hampshire Charitable Foundation; National Science Foundation [DUE-1239783]; NIFA [2014-68002-21782, 580424, 687305, 2010-67023-21705] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER; Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Industrial Innovation & Partnersh [1430260] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation (The Living Bridge); National Science Foundation (New Hampshire EPSCoR)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Carsey School of Public Policy; Sustainability Institute at University of New Hampshire; Agricultural and Food Research Initiative, U.S. Department of Agriculture; Neil and Louise Tillotson Fund of the New Hampshire Charitable Foundation; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture); Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Industrial Innovation & Partnersh(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG))","Renewable energy and climate questions on the Granite State Poll have been supported by grants from the National Science Foundation (The Living Bridge IIP-1230460 and 1430260 to EB and LCH; New Hampshire EPSCoR EPS-1101245 to LCH), and by the Carsey School of Public Policy and the Sustainability Institute at University of New Hampshire.

Probability sampling and a stratified technique were used to conduct a survey with subjects aged 20 years and over with higher education qualifications. The results showed that the majority of Malaysians are concerned about climate change and have heard about renewable energy. However, only two out of five people in Peninsular Malaysia have used renewable energy products.

Public opinion data from Pew and American National Election Studies surveys are used to show that racial identification and prejudices are increasingly correlated with opinions about climate change during the Obama presidency. Results show that racial identification became a significant predictor of climate change concern following Obama's election in 2008, and that high levels of racial resentment are strongly correlated with reduced agreement with the scientific consensus on climate change. These results offer evidence for an effect termed the spillover of racialization.

Scholars have long argued that environmental preferences decline during economic downturns as individuals prioritize short-term economic needs over longer-term environmental concerns. Yet, this assumption has rarely been subjected to rigorous empirical scrutiny at the individual level. The presumed link between economic and environmental preferences is revisited, using the first individual-level opinion panel (n=1043) of US climate attitudes, incorporating both self-reported and objective economic data. In contrast with prior studies that emphasize the role of economic downturns in driving environmental preference shifts, using a stronger identification strategy, there is little evidence that changes in either individual economic fortunes or local economic conditions are associated with decreased belief that climate change is happening or reduced prioritization of climate policy action. Instead, the evidence suggests that climate belief declines are associated with shifting political cues. These findings have important implications for understanding the dynamics of political conflict over environmental policy globally.","[Mildenberger, Matto] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Polit Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Leiserowitz, Anthony] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; Yale University,"Mildenberger, M (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Polit Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",mildenberger@polsci.ucsb.edu,"Leiserowitz, Anthony/HGB-4208-2022; Leiserowitz, Anthony/ABE-6529-2020","Leiserowitz, Anthony/0000-0001-5349-409X; Leiserowitz, Anthony/0000-0001-5349-409X; Mildenberger, Matto/0000-0001-5784-435X",Surdna Foundation; 11th Hour Project; Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment,"Surdna Foundation; 11th Hour Project(Ministry of Education, China - 111 Project); Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment","Funding support for this research came from the Surdna Foundation, the 11th Hour Project, and the Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment.",,53,73,81,10,54,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-4016,1743-8934,,ENVIRON POLIT,Environ.

This paper provides the first effort to estimate local climate and energy opinion variability outside the United States. Using a multi-level regression and post-stratification (MRP) approach, we estimate opinion in federal electoral districts and provinces. We demonstrate that a majority of the Canadian public consistently believes that climate change is happening. Belief in climate change's causes varies geographically, with more people attributing it to human activity in urban as opposed to rural areas.

The survey showed a majority of respondents (42%) willing to accept nuclear power if it would help tackle climate change. Following the disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Complex in Japan, an event triggered by the 11 March 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami, it was expected that support for nuclear power in Australia would change. In light of this, a follow-up survey was conducted in 2012. Indeed, the post-Fukushima results show a majority of respondents (40%) were not willing to accept nuclear power as an option to help tackle climate change, despite the fact that most Australians still believed nuclear power to offer a cleaner, more efficient option than coal, which currently dominates the domestic production of energy. Expanding the use of renewable energy sources (71%) remains the most popular option, followed by energy-efficient technologies (58%) and behavioural change (54%). Opposition to nuclear power will continue to be an obstacle against its future development even when posed as a viable solution to climate change. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, the authors analyse whether political parties and their leaders give due importance to the issues in their party literature and speeches. In order to investigate this phenomenon, the authors studied manifestos of those political parties represented in Parliament between 2008 and 2013, other official documents available on their websites and official statements of political leaders. The overall picture emerging is a substantial lack of attention paid to climate change, which is also poorly represented in the Italian media. One of the key problems, however, lies in what we define as the 'global' dimension of the climate change debate that makes it look unattractive to local political discourse (where Italian politics is traditionally rooted). We argue this impacts negatively on public opinion and the lack of Italian public policies aimed at ensuring sustainability and promoting good behaviour and environmental best practice.","[de Blasio, Emiliana] LUISS Univ, New Media Studies & Gender Polit, Rome, Italy; [Sorice, Michele] LUISS Univ, Polit Commun, Rome, Italy",Luiss Guido Carli University; Luiss Guido Carli University,"de Blasio, E (corresponding author), LUISS Guido Carli, Ctr Media & Commun Studies Massimo Baldini, Via Romania 32, I-00197 Rome, RM, Italy.",edeblasio@luiss.it; msorice@luiss.it,"Sorice, Michele/J-8752-2019","Sorice, Michele/0000-0003-3731-5690; De Blasio, Emiliana/0000-0002-1505-9713",,,,,23,9,9,0,0,INTELLECT LTD,BRISTOL,"THE MILL, PARNALL RD, BRISTOL, BS16 3JG, ENGLAND",1740-8296,2040-0918,,INT J MEDIA CULT POL,Int.

Securing public support for initiatives in this area is an important aim for policymakers and civil society actors concerned with the environment and sustainability. Although opinion polls and surveys consistently show proportions of the British population with sceptical views, little scholarly investigation has been undertaken into public opinion on climate change in Britain. This research note examines which factors affect citizens' awareness of and attitudes towards climate change. It undertakes multivariate analysis of nationally representative surveys to examine the social and attitudinal correlates of climate change attitudes. Accounting for sociological background, both political-ideological attitudes and general environmental orientations have strong effects. There is a clear gap in attitudes between men and women and strong evidence of differences by level of education. Climate change scepticism is associated with factors such as being male, less well educated, supporting the Conservatives and having right-wing ideological beliefs. The findings should encourage future research on the issue of climate change in British politics.

This article considers how two aspects of public salience, issue problem status and issue attention, work with environmental interest group membership to influence climate policy adoption in the American states. We contribute to the theoretical development of issue salience and offer alternative measures that capture differences in salience across subnational units. We find evidence that states where climate change is perceived to be a problem, and where attention to environmental issues is high, are more likely to adopt relevant policies. Furthermore, states with Republican majorities in either legislative chamber are less likely to adopt climate policies.

We focus on the ever-increasing role climate change has come to play over the past three decades in shaping how Americans think about broader environmental concerns. We show that news coverage of the environment has focused increasingly on climate change over time, while climate change concurrently has come to dominate all other environmental problems in the strength of its association with general environmental concern in opinion surveys. Panel studies provide evidence that the growing correlation between attitudes on climate change and the environment is predominantly due to the impact of the former on the latter. These developments have been consequential: we estimate that Americans' level of concern about the environment is now both more elevated and more polarized along party lines than if climate change did not occupy its dominant place on the environmental agenda. Climate change is likely just one example of how ascendant public opinion can have important consequences for politics and policy.","[Egan, Patrick J.] NYU, Polit & Publ Policy, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Konisky, David M.] Indiana Univ, Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN USA; [Mullin, Megan] Duke Univ, Environm Polit, Durham, NC USA",New York University; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Duke University,"Egan, PJ (corresponding author), NYU, Wilf Family Dept Polit, 19 W 4th St, New York, NY 10012 USA.",patrick.egan@nyu.edu,"Konisky, David/S-2618-2019","Konisky, David/0000-0002-1146-3938; Mullin, Megan/0000-0002-1936-802X",,,,,37,13,13,1,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0033-362X,1537-5331,,PUBLIC OPIN QUART,Public Opin.

People who were aware of the encyclical held more polarized attitudes toward climate change than those who were unaware of it. Whereas encyclical-aware liberals expressed heightened concerns about climate change, encyclical-aware conservatives expressed lower levels.

The success of these initiatives depends on public opinion, policy support and behaviours at appropriate scales. Public opinion, however, is typically measured with national surveys that obscure geographic variability across regions, states and localities. Here we present independently validated high-resolution opinion estimates using a multilevel regression and poststratification model. The model accurately predicts climate change beliefs, risk perceptions and policy preferences at the state, congressional district, metropolitan and county levels, using a concise set of demographic and geographic predictors. The analysis finds substantial variation in public opinion across the nation. Nationally, 63% of Americans believe global warming is happening, but county-level estimates range from 43 to 80%, leading to a diversity of political environments for climate policy. These estimates provide an important new source of information for policymakers, educators and scientists to more effectively address the challenges of climate change.","[Howe, Peter D.] Utah State Univ, Quinney Coll Nat Resources, Dept Environm & Soc, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Mildenberger, Matto; Marlon, Jennifer R.; Leiserowitz, Anthony] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; Yale University,"Howe, PD (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Quinney Coll Nat Resources, Dept Environm & Soc, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",peter.howe@usu.edu,"Leiserowitz, Anthony/HGB-4208-2022; Leiserowitz, Anthony/ABE-6529-2020","Leiserowitz, Anthony/0000-0001-5349-409X; Leiserowitz, Anthony/0000-0001-5349-409X; Mildenberger, Matto/0000-0001-5784-435X; Howe, Peter/0000-0002-1555-3746; Marlon, Jennifer/0000-0002-8299-9609",Skoll Global Threats fund; Energy Foundation; 11th Hour Project; Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; V.

The precise implications of the scientific claims about climate change, and the extent to which they pose dangers to various populations, are becoming intensely debated at many levels in relation to policy. How `danger' is interpreted will ultimately affect which actions are taken. In this paper, we examine how climate change is conceptualised by publics in Europe and in the USA. Although there is widespread concern about climate change, it is of secondary importance in comparison to other issues in people's daily lives. Most individuals relate to climate change through personal experience, knowledge, the balance of benefits and costs, and trust in other societal actors. We analyse these factors through findings from various surveys and studies, which highlight both the distinctiveness and some shared perspectives at a generalised level. We reflect upon these in relation to trust and responsibility for climate change action, and risk communication, supporting the call for discourses about climate change to also be situated in people's locality, as a means of increasing its saliency.","Univ E Anglia, Ctr Environm Risk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; Univ E Anglia, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Zuckerman Inst Connect Environm Res, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia; University of East Anglia,"Pidgeon, NF (corresponding author), Univ E Anglia, Ctr Environm Risk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",i.lorenzoni@uea.ac.uk; PidgeonN@cardiff.ac.uk,,,,,,,67,662,777,6,203,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

There are several well-established phenomena in psychology about how people perceive the prevalence of opinions, including the false consensus effect(1) (a tendency to overestimate how common one's 'own' opinion is) and pluralistic ignorance(2) (where most people privately reject an opinion, but assume incorrectly that most others accept it). We investigated these biases in people's opinions about the existence and causes of climate change. In two surveys conducted 12 months apart in Australia (n = 5,036; n = 5,030), respondents were asked their own opinion about the nature of climate change, and then asked to estimate levels of opinion among the general population. We demonstrate that opinions about climate change are subject to strong false consensus effects, that people grossly overestimate the numbers of people who reject the existence of climate change in the broader community, and that people with high false consensus bias are less likely to change their opinions.","[Leviston, Z.; Walker, I.] CSIRO, Ecosyst Sci, Perth, WA 6913, Australia; [Morwinski, S.] Tech Univ Dresden, D-01062 Dresden, Germany",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Technische Universitat Dresden,"Leviston, Z (corresponding author), CSIRO, Ecosyst Sci, Perth, WA 6913, Australia.",zoe.leviston@csiro.au,"Leviston, Zoe/G-5460-2010; Walker, Iain/G-5457-2010","Leviston, Zoe/0000-0002-4969-7916; Walker, Iain/0000-0002-1020-5873",CSIRO,CSIRO(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)),Research for this paper was financially supported by the CSIRO's Climate Adaptation Flagship.,,29,120,131,3,61,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1758-678X,,,NAT CLIM CHANGE,Nat.

It shows that religion's influence is multifaceted. Biblically literalist beliefs and to a lesser extent attendance at religious services, but not nominal religious affiliations, led Americans to view climate change as mostly natural and to express less concern over its consequences. Yet evangelical Protestants reporting frequent service attendance were distinctively more concerned about the effects of climate change.","Grand Valley State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Allendale, MI 49401 USA",Grand Valley State University,"Kilburn, HW (corresponding author), Grand Valley State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Allendale, MI 49401 USA.",kilburnw@mail.gvsu.edu,,,,,,,40,42,50,3,57,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0964-4016,1743-8934,,ENVIRON POLIT,Environ.
