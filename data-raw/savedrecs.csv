J,"McCright, AM; Dunlap, RE",Cool dudes: The denial of climate change among conservative white males in the United States,GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Political ideology; Race; Gender; Climate change denial; Public opinion,RISK PERCEPTION; POLITICS; GENDER; RACE; SCIENCE; KNOWLEDGE; BELIEFS; IMPACT; VIEWS,"We examine whether conservative white males are more likely than are other adults in the U.S. general public to endorse climate change denial. We draw theoretical and analytical guidance from the identity-protective cognition thesis explaining the white male effect and from recent political psychology scholarship documenting the heightened system-justification tendencies of political conservatives. We utilize public opinion data from ten Gallup surveys from 2001 to 2010, focusing specifically on five indicators of climate change denial. We find that conservative white males are significantly more likely than are other Americans to endorse denialist views on all five items, and that these differences are even greater for those conservative white males who self-report understanding global warming very well. Furthermore, the results of our multivariate logistic regression models reveal that the conservative white male effect remains significant when controlling for the direct effects of political ideology, race, and gender as well as the effects of nine control variables. We thus conclude that the unique views of conservative white males contribute significantly to the high level of climate change denial in the United States. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, in the case of climate change, public polarization about the issue has increased in recent years, not diminished. In this study, we draw from theories of motivated reasoning, social identity, and persuasion to examine how science-based messages may increase public polarization on controversial science issues such as climate change. Exposing 240 adults to simulated news stories about possible climate change health impacts on different groups, we found the influence of identification with potential victims was contingent on participants' political partisanship. This partisanship increased the degree of political polarization on support for climate mitigation policies and resulted in a boomerang effect among Republican participants. Implications for understanding the role of motivated reasoning within the context of science communication are discussed.","[Hart, P.

Here, using an unprecedented survey of 119 countries, we determine the relative influence of socio-demographic characteristics, geography, perceived well-being, and beliefs on public climate change awareness and risk perceptions at national scales. Worldwide, educational attainment is the single strongest predictor of climate change awareness. Understanding the anthropogenic cause of climate change is the strongest predictor of climate change risk perceptions, particularly in Latin America and Europe, whereas perception of local temperature change is the strongest predictor in many African and Asian countries. However, other key factors associated with public awareness and risk perceptions highlight the need to develop tailored climate communication strategies for individual nations. The results suggest that improving basic education, climate literacy, and public understanding of the local dimensions of climate change are vital to public engagement and support for climate action.","[Lee, Tien Ming] Columbia Univ, Earth Inst, Dept Ecol Evolut & Environm Biol, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Lee, Tien Ming; Markowitz, Ezra M.] Columbia Univ, Ctr Res Environm Decis, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Lee, Tien Ming; Howe, Peter D.; Ko, Chia-Ying; Leiserowitz, Anthony A.] Yale Univ, Yale Project Climate Change Commun, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Markowitz, Ezra M.] Columbia Univ, Earth Inst, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Markowitz, Ezra M.] Princeton Univ, Princeton Inst Int & Reg Studies, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Markowitz, Ezra M.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Howe, Peter D.] Utah State Univ, Dept Environm & Soc, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Ko, Chia-Ying] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Ko, Chia-Ying] Acad Sinica, Res Ctr Environm Changes, Taipei 11529, Taiwan",Columbia University; Columbia University; Yale University; Columbia University; Princeton University; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; Yale University; Academia Sinica - Taiwan,"Lee, TM (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Program Sci Technol & Environm Policy, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",tienminglee@gmail.com; anthony.leiserowitz@yale.edu,"Leiserowitz, Anthony/ABE-6529-2020; Leiserowitz, Anthony/HGB-4208-2022","Leiserowitz, Anthony/0000-0001-5349-409X; Leiserowitz, Anthony/0000-0001-5349-409X; Howe, Peter/0000-0002-1555-3746; Markowitz, Ezra/0000-0002-8140-2970","Earth Institute Fellows Program, Columbia University; Yale Project on Climate Change Communication","Earth Institute Fellows Program, Columbia University; Yale Project on Climate Change Communication","This research was supported in part by the Earth Institute Fellows Program, Columbia University and the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication (T.M.L).

Geological media suitable for CO2 storage through various physical and chemical trapping mechanisms must have the necessary capacity and injectivity, and must confine the CO2 and impede its lateral migration and/or vertical leakage to other strata, shallow potable groundwater, soils and/or atmosphere. Such geological media are mainly oil and gas reservoirs and deep saline aquifers that are found in sedimentary basins. Storage of gases, including CO2, in these media has been demonstrated on a commercial scale by enhanced oil recovery operations, natural gas storage and acid gas disposal. Some of the risks associated With CO2 capture and geological storage are similar to, and comparable with, any other industrial activity for which extensive safety and regulatory frameworks are in place. Specific risks associated with CO2 storage relate to the operational (injection) phase and to the post-operational phase, of which the risks of most concern are those posed by the potential for acute or chronic CO2 leakage from the storage site. Notwithstanding the global climate effect of CO2 returning to the atmosphere, the local risks to health and safety, environment and equity need to be properly assessed and managed. Currently there are very few operations in the world where CO2 is injected and stored in the ground, mostly if not exclusively as a by-product of an operation driven by other considerations than climate change, such as oil production or regulatory requirements regarding H2S. These operations show that there are no major technological barriers to CO2 geological storage, and that challenges and barriers lie elsewhere. A major challenge in the implementation of CO2 geological storage is the high cost of CO2 capture, particularly for dilute streams like those from power plants and industrial combustion processes. There are concerns that public opinion and public's acceptance or rejection of this technology will likely affect the large-scale implementation of CO2 geological storage. The current paucity of policy, legislation and a proper regulatory framework in most jurisdictions is presently the most significant barrier. The resolution of these challenges will affect the economics and financial risk of CO2 geological storage and will accelerate or delay the deployment of this technology for reducing anthropogenic CO2 emissions into the atmosphere.

Utilizing Stimson's method of constructing aggregate opinion measures, data from 74 separate surveys over a 9-year period are used to construct quarterly measures of public concern over global climate change. We examine five factors that should account for changes in levels of concern: 1) extreme weather events, 2) public access to accurate scientific information, 3) media coverage, 4) elite cues, and 5) movement/countermovement advocacy. A time-series analysis indicates that elite cues and structural economic factors have the largest effect on the level of public concern about climate change. While media coverage exerts an important influence, this coverage is itself largely a function of elite cues and economic factors. Weather extremes have no effect on aggregate public opinion. Promulgation of scientific information to the public on climate change has a minimal effect. The implication would seem to be that information-based science advocacy has had only a minor effect on public concern, while political mobilization by elites and advocacy groups is critical in influencing climate change concern.","[Brulle, Robert J.] Drexel Univ, Dept Culture & Commun, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Carmichael, Jason] McGill Univ, Dept Sociol, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T5, Canada; [Jenkins, J.

And yet previous studies of the mass public's subjective assessments of the risks of global warming and climate change have not sufficiently examined public informedness, public confidence in climate scientists, and the role of personal efficacy in affecting global warming outcomes. By examining the results of a survey on an original and representative sample of Americans, we find that these three forces-informedness, confidence in scientists, and personal efficacy-are related in interesting and unexpected ways, and exert significant influence on risk assessments of global warming and climate change. In particular, more informed respondents both feel less personally responsible for global warming, and also show less concern for global warming. We also find that confidence in scientists has unexpected effects: respondents with high confidence in scientists feel less responsible for global warming, and also show less concern for global warming. These results have substantial implications for the interaction between scientists and the public in general, and for the public discussion of global warming and climate change in particular.","[Kellstedt, Paul M.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Polit Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Zahran, Sammy; Vedlitz, Arnold] Texas A&M Univ, George Bush Sch Govt & Publ Serv, Inst Sci Technol & Publ Policy, College Stn, TX USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Bush School of Government & Public Service,"Kellstedt, PM (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Polit Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",kellstedt@polisci.tamu.edu,,,,,,,60,517,641,8,265,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0272-4332,1539-6924,,RISK ANAL,Risk Anal.,FEB,2008,28,1,,,,,113,126,,10.1111/j.1539-6924.2008.01010.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1539-6924.2008.01010.x,,,14,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences",269GO,18304110,,,,2024-06-14,WOS:000253637700009,View Full Record in Web of Science,1,1,custom,,,

Yet, in light of the increasing politicization of (climate) science, and the attempts of vested-interest groups to undermine the scientific consensus on climate change through organized disinformation campaigns, identifying ways to effectively engage with the public about the issue across the political spectrum has proven difficult. A growing body of research suggests that one promising way to counteract the politicization of science is to convey the high level of normative agreement (consensus) among experts about the reality of human-caused climate change. Yet, much prior research examining public opinion dynamics in the context of climate change has done so under conditions with limited external validity. Moreover, no research to date has examined how to protect the public from the spread of influential misinformation about climate change. The current research bridges this divide by exploring how people evaluate and process consensus cues in a polarized information environment. Furthermore, evidence is provided that it is possible to preemptively protect (inoculate) public attitudes about climate change against real-world misinformation.","[van der Linden, Sander] Univ Cambridge, Dept Psychol, Cambridge CB2 3EB, England; [Leiserowitz, Anthony; Rosenthal, Seth] Yale Univ, Yale Program Climate Change Commun, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Maibach, Edward] George Mason Univ, Ctr Climate Change Commun, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",University of Cambridge; Yale University; George Mason University,"van der Linden, S (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Psychol, Cambridge CB2 3EB, England.",sander.vanderlinden@psychol.cam.ac.uk,"van der Linden, Sander/ABE-6441-2020; Leiserowitz, Anthony/ABE-6529-2020; Leiserowitz, Anthony/HGB-4208-2022","van der Linden, Sander/0000-0002-0269-1744; Leiserowitz, Anthony/0000-0001-5349-409X; Leiserowitz, Anthony/0000-0001-5349-409X",Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; 11th Hour Foundation; Energy Foundation; Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment,Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; 11th Hour Foundation; Energy Foundation; Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment,"The authors acknowledge the Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment, the 11th Hour Foundation, the Energy Foundation, and the Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment for their generous support.

Learning from its mistakes in overtly attacking environmental regulations in the early 1980s, this countermovement has subsequently exercised a more subtle form of power characterized by non-decision-making. We examine the conservative movement's efforts to undermine climate science and policy in the USA over the last two decades by using this second dimension of power. The conservative movement has employed four non-decision-making techniques to challenge the legitimacy of climate science and prevent progress in policy-making. We argue that reflexive modernization scholars should focus more attention on similar forces of anti-reflexivity that continue to shape the overall direction of our social, political and economic order, and the life chances of many citizens. Indeed, better understanding of the forces and effectiveness of anti-reflexivity may very well be crucial for societal resilience and adaptation, especially in the face of global environmental problems like climate change.","[McCright, Aaron M.] Michigan State Univ, Lyman Briggs Coll, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [McCright, Aaron M.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Sociol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Dunlap, Riley E.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Sociol, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA",Michigan State University; Michigan State University; Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater,"McCright, AM (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Lyman Briggs Coll, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",mccright@msu.edu; rdunlap@okstate.edu,"Dunlap, Riley E./Z-1676-2019; McCright, Aaron Matthew/Z-1967-2019","Dunlap, Riley E./0000-0002-7047-3757;",,,,,106,384,447,1,82,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0263-2764,1460-3616,,THEOR CULT SOC,Theory Cult.

J,"Hamilton, LC","Education, politics and opinions about climate change evidence for interaction effects",CLIMATIC CHANGE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,CHANGE POLICY; INFORMATION; GENDER; RISK,"U.S. public opinion regarding climate change has become increasingly polarized in recent years, as partisan think tanks and others worked to recast an originally scientific topic into a political wedge issue. Nominally scientific arguments against taking anthropogenic climate change seriously have been publicized to reach informed but ideologically receptive audiences. Reflecting the success of such arguments, polls have noted that concern about climate change increased with education among Democrats, but decreased with education among Republicans. These observations lead to the hypothesis that there exist interaction (non-additive) effects between education or knowledge and political orientation, net of other background factors, in predicting public concern about climate change. Two regional telephone surveys, conducted in New Hampshire (n = 541) and Michigan (n = 1, 008) in 2008, included identical climate-change questions that provide opportunities to test this hypothesis. Multivariate analysis of both surveys finds significant interactions. These empirical results fit with theoretical interpretations and several other recent studies. They suggest that the classically identified social bases of concern about the environment in general, and climate in particular, have shifted in recent years. Narrowcast media, including the many Web sites devoted to discrediting climate-change concerns, provide ideal conduits for channeling contrarian arguments to an audience predisposed to believe and electronically spread them further. Active-response Web sites by climate scientists could prove critical to counterbalancing contrarian arguments.","Univ New Hampshire, Dept Sociol, Durham, NH 03824 USA",University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire,"Hamilton, LC (corresponding author), Univ New Hampshire, Dept Sociol, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",Lawrence.Hamilton@unh.edu,,,Charles Stewart Mott Foundation; Carsey Institute at the University of New Hampshire,Charles Stewart Mott Foundation; Carsey Institute at the University of New Hampshire,"This research has been supported by a grant from the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation, and by the Carsey Institute at the University of New Hampshire, with cooperation from the UNH Survey Center.

The success of these initiatives depends on public opinion, policy support and behaviours at appropriate scales. Public opinion, however, is typically measured with national surveys that obscure geographic variability across regions, states and localities. Here we present independently validated high-resolution opinion estimates using a multilevel regression and poststratification model. The model accurately predicts climate change beliefs, risk perceptions and policy preferences at the state, congressional district, metropolitan and county levels, using a concise set of demographic and geographic predictors. The analysis finds substantial variation in public opinion across the nation. Nationally, 63% of Americans believe global warming is happening, but county-level estimates range from 43 to 80%, leading to a diversity of political environments for climate policy. These estimates provide an important new source of information for policymakers, educators and scientists to more effectively address the challenges of climate change.","[Howe, Peter D.] Utah State Univ, Quinney Coll Nat Resources, Dept Environm & Soc, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Mildenberger, Matto; Marlon, Jennifer R.; Leiserowitz, Anthony] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; Yale University,"Howe, PD (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Quinney Coll Nat Resources, Dept Environm & Soc, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",peter.howe@usu.edu,"Leiserowitz, Anthony/HGB-4208-2022; Leiserowitz, Anthony/ABE-6529-2020","Leiserowitz, Anthony/0000-0001-5349-409X; Leiserowitz, Anthony/0000-0001-5349-409X; Marlon, Jennifer/0000-0002-8299-9609; Howe, Peter/0000-0002-1555-3746; Mildenberger, Matto/0000-0001-5784-435X",Skoll Global Threats fund; Energy Foundation; 11th Hour Project; Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; V.

This article aims to examine why citizens support or reject climate policies. For this purpose, we provide a cross-disciplinary overview of empirical and experimental research on public attitudes and preferences that has emerged in the last few years. The various factors influencing policy support are divided into three general categories: (1) social-psychological factors and climate change perception, such as the positive influences of left-wing political orientation, egalitarian worldviews, environmental and self-transcendent values, climate change knowledge, risk perception, or emotions like interest and hope; (2) the perception of climate policy and its design, which includes, among others, the preference of pull over push measures, the positive role of perceived policy effectiveness, the level of policy costs, as well as the positive effect of perceived policy fairness and the recycling of potential policy revenues; (3) contextual factors, such as the positive influence of social trust, norms and participation, wider economic, political and geographical aspects, or the different effects of specific media events and communications. Finally, we discuss the findings and provide suggestions for future research.Policy relevancePublic opinion is a significant determinant of policy change in democratic countries. Policy makers may be reluctant to implement climate policies if they expect public opposition. This article seeks to provide a better understanding of the various factors influencing public responses to climate policy proposals. Most of the studied factors include perceptions about climate change, policy and its attributes, all of which are amenable to intervention. The acquired insights can thus assist in improving policy design and communication with the overarching objective to garner more public support for effective climate policy.","[Drews, Stefan; Van den Bergh, Jeroen C.

The current challenges of sustainability, food security and climate change are engaging researchers in exploring the field of nanotechnology as new source of key improvements for the agricultural sector. However, concrete contributions are still uncertain. Despite the numerous potential advantages of nanotechnology and the growing trends in publications and patents, agricultural applications have not yet made it to the market. Several factors could explain the scarcity of commercial applications. On the one hand, industry experts stress that agricultural nanotechnology does not demonstrate a sufficient economic return to counterbalance the high initial production investments. On the other hand, new nanotech regulation in the EU might create regulatory uncertainty for products already on the market and affect public perception. However, recent studies demonstrate that public opinion is not negative towards nanotechnology and that the introduction on the market of nanotech products with clear benefits will likely drive consumer acceptance of more sensitive applications. The rapid progress of nanotechnology in other key industries may over time be transferred to agricultural applications as well, and facilitate their development. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Most populations are currently declining, and some face extirpation. In southern Canada, caribou range has retreated considerably over the past century. The ultimate reason for their decline is habitat alterations by industrial activities. The proximate causes are predation and, to a lesser extent, overharvest. The most southerly populations of Mountain caribou are at imminent risk of extirpation. Mountain caribou are threatened by similar industrial activities as Boreal caribou, and face increasing harassment from motorized winter recreational activities. Most populations of Migratory Tundra caribou are currently declining. Although these caribou fluctuate in abundance over decades, changing harvest technologies, climate change, increasing industrial development and human presence in the North raise doubts over whether recent declines will be followed by recoveries. The Peary caribou (Rangifer tarandus pearyi J.A. Allen, 1902), a distinct subspecies endemic to Canada's High Arctic, has suffered drastic declines caused by severe weather, hunting and predation. It faces an increasing threat from climate change. While some questions remain about the reasons for the decline of Migratory Tundra caribou, research has clearly identified several threats to the persistence of Boreal, Mountain, and Peary caribou. Scientific knowledge, however, has neither effectively influenced policies nor galvanized public opinion sufficiently to push governments into effective actions. The persistence of many caribou populations appears incompatible with the ongoing pace of industrial development.","[Festa-Bianchet, M.] Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Biol, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada; [Festa-Bianchet, M.] Univ Sherbrooke, Ctr Etud Nord, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada; [Ray, J.

One reason for this decline is the 'manufacture of doubt' by political and vested interests, which often challenge the existence of the scientific consensus. The role of perceived consensus in shaping public opinion is therefore of considerable interest: in particular, it is unknown whether consensus determines people's beliefs causally. It is also unclear whether perception of consensus can override people's 'worldviews', which are known to foster rejection of AGW. Study 1 shows that acceptance of several scientific propositions-from HIV/AIDS to AGW-is captured by a common factor that is correlated with another factor that captures perceived scientific consensus. Study 2 reveals a causal role of perceived consensus by showing that acceptance of AGW increases when consensus is highlighted. Consensus information also neutralizes the effect of worldview.","[Lewandowsky, Stephan; Gignac, Gilles E.; Vaughan, Samuel] Univ Western Australia, Sch Psychol, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia",University of Western Australia,"Lewandowsky, S (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, Sch Psychol, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",stephan.lewandowsky@uwa.edu.au,"Lewandowsky, Stephan/L-4272-2019","Lewandowsky, Stephan/0000-0003-1655-2013; Gignac, Gilles/0000-0002-4900-6855",Australian Research Council; Australian Professorial Fellowship; Australian Research Council (ARC); Australian Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Professorial Fellowship(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council (ARC)(Australian Research Council); Australian Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency(Australian Government),"This research was supported by a Discovery Grant and a Linkage Grant from the Australian Research Council and an Australian Professorial Fellowship to the first author.

The technique adopted here, namely integrated assessment (IA) focus groups, in which groups of randomly selected individuals in Switzerland looked at models of possible consequences of climate change and questioned specialists as to their accuracy and meaning, revealed a rich assembly of reactions. Respondents were alarmed about the consequences of high-energy futures, and mollified by images of low-energy futures. Yet they also erected a series of psychological barriers to justify why they should not act either individually or through collective institutions to mitigate climate change. From the viewpoint of changing their lifestyles of material comfort and high-energy dependence, they regarded the consequences of possible behavioural shift arising from the need to meet mitigation measures as more daunting. To overcome the dissonance created in their minds they created a number of socio-psychological denial mechanisms. Such mechanisms heightened the costs of shifting away from comfortable lifestyles, set blame on the inaction of others, including governments, and emphasised doubts regarding the immediacy of personal action when the effects of climate change seemed uncertain and far away. These findings suggest that more attention needs to be given to the social and psychological motivations as to why individuals erect barriers to their personal commitment to climate change mitigation, even when professing anxiety over climate futures. Prolonged and progressive packages of information tailored to cultural models or organised belief patterns, coupled to greater community based policy incentives may help to widen the basis of personal and moral responsibility.

Evidence from a content analysis of climate change coverage on Fox News, CNN, and MSNBC during 2007 and 2008 demonstrates that Fox takes a more dismissive tone toward climate change than CNN and MSNBC. Fox also interviews a greater ratio of climate change doubters to believers. An analysis of 2008 survey data from a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults finds a negative association between Fox News viewership and acceptance of global warming, even after controlling for numerous potential confounding factors. Conversely, viewing CNN and MSNBC is associated with greater acceptance of global warming. Further analyses reveal that the relationship between cable news viewership (both Fox and CNN/MSNBC) and global warming acceptance is stronger among Republicans than among Democrats. That is, the views of Republicans are strongly linked with the news outlet they watch, regardless of how well that outlet aligns with their political predispositions. In contrast, Democrats don't vary much in their beliefs as a function of cable news use.

We ask whether individuals with more general education and greater science knowledge, measured in terms of science education and science literacy, display more (or less) polarized beliefs on several such issues. We report secondary analyses of a nationally representative dataset (the General Social Survey), examining the predictors of beliefs regarding six potentially controversial issues. We find that beliefs are correlated with both political and religious identity for stem cell research, the Big Bang, and human evolution, and with political identity alone on climate change. Individuals with greater education, science education, and science literacy display more polarized beliefs on these issues. We find little evidence of political or religious polarization regarding nanotechnology and genetically modified foods. On all six topics, people who trust the scientific enterprise more are also more likely to accept its findings.

This has led to a search for explanations for this decline, and great deal of speculation that there has been a fundamental shift in public trust in climate science. We evaluate over thirty years of public opinion data about global warming and the environment, and suggest that the decline in belief about climate change is most likely driven by the economic insecurity caused by the Great Recession. Evidence from European nations further supports an economic explanation for changing public opinion. The pattern is consistent with more than forty years of public opinion about environmental policy. Popular alternative explanations for declining support - partisan politicization, biased media coverage, fluctuations in short-term weather conditions - are unable to explain the suddenness and timing of opinion trends. The implication of these findings is that the crisis of confidence in climate change will likely rebound after labor market conditions improve, but not until then. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

A quantitative study of public perceptions and risk framing in Britain,GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS,,,English,Article,,,,,,nuclear power; climate change; British public risk perceptions; framing; energy policy,UNITED-STATES; UK; POLICY,"The UK is witnessing a new line in political debate around new nuclear energy generation as one potential feature of future energy policy, specifically for contributing to climate change mitigation alongside energy security. Little is known about how ordinary citizens might be responding to this refraining. This paper reports the results from a major British survey (n = 1491) undertaken in the autumn of 2005. The consistent message is that while higher proportions of the British public are prepared to accept nuclear power if they believe it contributes to climate change mitigation, this is a highly conditional view, with very few actively preferring this over renewable sources given the choice. People see both climate change and nuclear power as problematic in terms of risks and express only a 'reluctant acceptance' of nuclear power as a 'solution' to climate change. The combined data from this survey can also be interpreted as an indication of the complexity surrounding beliefs about energy futures and the difficulty of undertaking simplistic risk-risk tradeoffs within any single framing of the issues; such as nuclear energy versus climate change. The results also indicate that it would be unwise, in the UK as elsewhere, to simplistically assume that there exists any single or stable public 'opinion' on such complex matters. We conclude with a discussion of the role and implications of the survey evidence for the policy process. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Supporters are found to be younger, better educated, and more likely to own their own home. Opponents are more likely to earn over $200,000/year, and more likely to expect to see the project from their daily routine. The overwhelming majority of the population expects negative impacts from the project; much smaller numbers expect positive effects. When asked which factors most affected their position, the most frequently mentioned was damage to marine life/environmental impacts, followed by electricity rates, aesthetics, and impacts on fishing or boating. When the expectations expressed by our respondents are compared with the findings of the project's draft Environmental Impact Statement, many of the beliefs upon which opinion are based appear to be factually incorrect. Finally, we tested whether change in the project would affect support. The biggest change was an increase in the level of support, by 47% of the sample, if the project was the first of 300 such projects, in sum having proportionately larger impacts as well as greater benefits.

The results demonstrate that climategate had a significant effect on public beliefs in global warming and trust in scientists. The loss of trust in scientists, however, was primarily among individuals with a strongly individualistic worldview or politically conservative ideology. Nonetheless, Americans overall continued to trust scientists more than other sources of information about global warming.

Five factors should account for changes in levels of concern: extreme weather events, public access to accurate scientific information, media coverage, elite cues, and movement/countermovement advocacy. Structural equation modeling indicates that elite cues, movement advocacy efforts, weather, and structural economic factors influence the level of public concern about climate change. While media coverage exerts an important influence, it is itself largely a function of elite cues and economic factors. Promulgation to the public of scientific information on climate change has no effect. Information-based science advocacy has had only a minor effect on public concern, while political mobilization by elites and advocacy groups is critical in influencing climate change concern.","[Carmichael, Jason T.] McGill Univ, Dept Sociol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Brulle, Robert J.] Drexel Univ, Dept Sociol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",McGill University; Drexel University,"Carmichael, JT (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Sociol, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",jason.carmichael@mcgill.ca,,,Energy Foundation [21037],Energy Foundation,This work was supported in part by the Energy Foundation 21037.,,76,212,233,15,161,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-4016,1743-8934,,ENVIRON POLIT,Environ.

Party sorting theory holds that such political polarization among elites will likely extend to the general public. Analyzing General Social Survey data from 1974 to 2012. we examine whether political polarization has occurred on support for government spending on environmental protection over this time period in the US general public. We find that there has been significant partisan and ideological polarization on support for environmental spending since 1992 consistent with the expectations of party sorting theory. This political polarization on environmental concern in the general public will likely endure save for political convergence on environmental concern among elites in the near future. Such polarization likely will inhibit the further development and implementation of environmental policy and the diffusion of environmentally friendly behaviors. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Instead, the structure of Americans' attitudes toward belief in climate change's existence, concern about its consequences, and demand for policy response is similar to that regarding many other issues in contemporary US politics: stability in aggregate opinion that masks partisan and ideological polarization enhanced by communications from elites. But features of the climate change problem elicit some distinctive determinants of opinion, including individuals' trust in science, risk processing, and personal experience. Although our review of the literature and data leaves us skeptical that majority opinion will spur elected officials anytime soon to undertake the costly solutions necessary to tackle this problem comprehensively at the national level, we identify several avenues by which attitudes might promote less substantial but nevertheless consequential policy action.","[Egan, Patrick J.] NYU, Wilf Family Dept Polit, 550 1st Ave, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Mullin, Megan] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA",New York University; Duke University,"Egan, PJ (corresponding author), NYU, Wilf Family Dept Polit, 550 1st Ave, New York, NY 10003 USA.",patrick.egan@nyu.edu; megan.mullin@duke.edu,,"Mullin, Megan/0000-0002-1936-802X",,,,,89,201,237,12,118,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1094-2939,1545-1577,,ANNU REV POLIT SCI,Annu.

A substantial body of social science research examines the patterns of climate change views in the general publics of countries around the world. In this review essay, we identify the strongest and most consistent predictors of key dimensions of climate change views within many countries, and we also discuss the prevailing theoretical explanations of these specific effects. Since the US has yet to adopt comprehensive climate change mitigation policy and has historically played an obstructionist role in international climate negotiations, we further explain the political dynamics of US climate change views that help characterize the US's outlier status among industrial capitalist democracies. We then present an integrative theoretical framework-based upon an extension of the anti-reflexivity thesis-that explains why the strength and consistency of predictors relate to how closely those predictors distinguish ideological and material positions defending the industrial capitalist system from those positions accepting that it should be reformed or restructured. We end with a brief discussion of promising avenues through which future research may address key gaps in our understanding of climate change views. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We provide estimates of public support for different types of climate agreements in France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Using data from a large-scale experimental survey, we explore how three key dimensions of global climate cooperation-costs and distribution, participation, and enforcement-affect individuals' willingness to support these international efforts. We find that design features have significant effects on public support. Specifically, our results indicate that support is higher for global climate agreements that involve lower costs, distribute costs according to prominent fairness principles, encompass more countries, and include a small sanction if a country fails to meet its emissions reduction targets. In contrast to well-documented baseline differences in public support for climate mitigation efforts, opinion responds similarly to changes in climate policy design in all four countries. We also find that the effects of institutional design features can bring about decisive changes in the level of public support for a global climate agreement. Moreover, the results appear consistent with the view that the sensitivity of public support to design features reflects underlying norms of reciprocity and individuals' beliefs about the potential effectiveness of specific agreements.","[Bechtel, Michael M.] Univ St Gallen, Dept Polit Sci, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland; [Scheve, Kenneth F.] Stanford Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",University of St Gallen; Stanford University,"Bechtel, MM (corresponding author), Univ St Gallen, Dept Polit Sci, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland.",mbechtel.mail@gmail.com; scheve@stanford.edu,"Bechtel, Michael M./T-9309-2019","Bechtel, Michael M./0000-0002-6080-5367",Swiss Network of International Studies; Yale University's MacMillan Center for International Area Studies; Yale University's Institution for Social and Policy Studies,Swiss Network of International Studies; Yale University's MacMillan Center for International Area Studies; Yale University's Institution for Social and Policy Studies,"We thank Steve Ansolabehere, Dave Baron, Andre Bachtiger, Nikhar Gaikwad, Dominik Hangartner, Bob Keohane, Jon Krosnick, Lukas Schmid, Dustin Tingley, C.

However, since 2011 several states have weakened their renewable energy policies. Public opinion will probably be crucial for determining whether states expand or contract their renewable energy policies in the future. Here we show that a majority of the public in most states supports renewable portfolio standards, which require a portion of the electricity mix to come from renewables. However, policy design and framing can strongly influence public support. Using a survey experiment, we show that effects of renewable portfolio standards bills on residential electricity costs, jobs and pollution, as well as bipartisan elite support, are all important drivers of public support. In many states, these bills' design and framing can push public opinion above or below majority support.","[Stokes, Leah C.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Polit Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Warshaw, Christopher] MIT, Dept Polit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Warshaw, C (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Polit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",cwarshaw@mit.edu,"Warshaw, Christopher/AAM-4838-2021",,MIT Energy Initiative,MIT Energy Initiative,"Funding for this research was provided by the MIT Energy Initiative.

Books denying AGW are a crucial means of attacking climate science and scientists, and we examine the links between conservative think tanks (CTTs) and 108 climate change denial books published through 2010. We find a strong link, albeit noticeably weaker for the growing number of self-published denial books. We also examine the national origins of the books and the academic backgrounds of their authors or editors, finding that with the help of American CTTs climate change denial has spread to several other nations and that an increasing portion of denial books are produced by individuals with no scientific training. It appears that at least 90% of denial books do not undergo peer review, allowing authors or editors to recycle scientifically unfounded claims that are then amplified by the conservative movement, media, and political elites.","[Dunlap, Riley E.] Oklahoma State Univ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Dunlap, Riley E.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Sociol, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Jacques, Peter J.] Univ Cent Florida, Orlando, FL 32816 USA",Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater; Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater; State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida,"Dunlap, RE (corresponding author), Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Sociol, 439 Murray Hall, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",rdunlap@okstate.edu,"Jacques, Peter J./JAC-6571-2023; Jacques, Peter/M-4111-2019; Dunlap, Riley E./Z-1676-2019","Dunlap, Riley E./0000-0002-7047-3757; Jacques, Peter/0000-0003-4894-8688",,,,,34,182,201,2,95,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0002-7642,1552-3381,,AM BEHAV SCI,Am.

Scientists' claims about global warming failed to attract much public attention until the extraordinary heat and drought of the summer of '88 created a social scare. That is, environmental claims are most likely to be honored-and accelerate demands in the political arena-when they piggyback on dramatic real-world events.

We bring together micro-level geospatial data on extreme weather events from NOAA's Storm Events Database with public opinion data from multiple years of the Cooperative Congressional Election Study to study this question. We find evidence of a modest, but discernible positive relationship between experiencing extreme weather activity and expressions of concern about climate change. However, the effect only materializes for recent extreme weather activity; activity that occurred over longer periods of time does not affect public opinion.

However, local climate-change experience may play an important role in adaptation and mitigation behaviour and policy support(1-3). Previous research indicates that people can perceive and adapt to aspects of climate variability and change based on personal observations(4-6). Experience with local weather may also influence global warming beliefs(7,8). Here we examine the extent to which respondents in 89 countries detect recent changes in average local temperatures. We demonstrate that public perceptions correspond with patterns of observed temperature change from climate records: individuals who live in places with rising average temperatures are more likely than others to perceive local warming. As global climate change intensifies, changes in local temperatures and weather patterns may be increasingly detected by the global public. These findings also suggest that public opinion of climate change may shift, at least in part, in response to the personal experience of climate change.","[Howe, Peter D.; Lee, Tien Ming; Ko, Chia-Ying; Leiserowitz, Anthony] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06405 USA; [Markowitz, Ezra M.] Princeton Univ, Princeton Inst Int & Reg Studies, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Lee, Tien Ming] Columbia Univ, Ctr Res Environm Decis, Dept Ecol Evolut & Environm Biol, New York, NY 10025 USA; [Lee, Tien Ming] Columbia Univ, Earth Inst, New York, NY 10025 USA; [Ko, Chia-Ying] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Yale University; Princeton University; Columbia University; Columbia University; Yale University,"Howe, PD (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06405 USA.",peter.howe@yale.edu,"Leiserowitz, Anthony/ABE-6529-2020; Leiserowitz, Anthony/HGB-4208-2022","Leiserowitz, Anthony/0000-0001-5349-409X; Leiserowitz, Anthony/0000-0001-5349-409X; Howe, Peter/0000-0002-1555-3746; Markowitz, Ezra/0000-0002-8140-2970","National Science Foundation [1102785]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci [1102785] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","This research was financially supported in part by the National Science Foundation (Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant #1102785).

Identity campaigns are based on the idea that more effective environmental messages developed through the application of cognitive science by professional communications experts can favorably influence public opinion, and thus support legislative action to remedy this issue. Based on a review of the sociological and psychological literature regarding social change and mobilization, I argue that while this approach may offer short term advantages, it is most likely incapable of developing the large scale mobilization necessary to enact the massive social and economic changes necessary to address global warming. Specifically, theoretical and empirical research on the role of the public sphere, civil society and social movements shows that democratic civic engagement is core to successful social change efforts. However, identity campaigns focus on a communications process that centers on elite led one way communications, which falls to allow for any form of civic engagement and public dialogue. This undermines the creation of a democratic process of change and reinforces the professionalization of political discourse, leading to a weakening of the mobilization capacity over this issue of global warming. The essay concludes with the outlines of an environmental communication process that aims at enhancing civic engagement and democratic decision making.","Drexel Univ, Dept Culture & Commun, Philadelphia, PA 19119 USA",Drexel University,"Brulle, RJ (corresponding author), Drexel Univ, Dept Culture & Commun, 3141 Chestnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19119 USA.",brullerj@drexel.edu,,,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0819423] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0819412] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,108,171,215,8,148,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1752-4032,1752-4040,,ENVIRON COMMUN,Environ.

Research in political science and related fields offers systematic and empirically well-supported explanations for why solving the climate problem has turned out to be more difficult than originally anticipated. After reviewing this research, I focus on four areas in which we know less: (a) institutional design features that may help inmitigating or overcoming fundamental problems in the global cooperative effort; (b) factors that are driving variation in climate policies at national and subnational levels; (c) driving forces of climate policy beyond the state, in particular civil society, the science-policy interface, and public opinion; and (d) sociopolitical consequences of failing to avoid major climatic changes. The article concludes by identifying key questions at the micro, meso, and macro levels that should be addressed by political scientists in the coming years. In view of the fact that governance efforts at the global level are progressing very slowly, greater attention to bottom-up dynamics appears useful, both for analytical reasons (there is lots of variation to be explained) and for normative reasons.","[Bernauer, Thomas] ETH, Ctr Comparat & Int Studies, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Bernauer, Thomas] ETH, Inst Environm Decis, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Bernauer, T (corresponding author), ETH, Ctr Comparat & Int Studies, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",thbe0520@ethz.ch,,"Bernauer, Thomas/0000-0002-3775-6245",,,,,167,170,184,2,149,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1094-2939,1545-1577,978-0-8243-3316-4,ANNU REV POLIT SCI,Annu.

The literature is large and spans multiple contexts, methods, theoretical and disciplinary perspectives and paradigms. While this diversity is in many ways healthy, experience suggests that it can be confusing for those without close knowledge of its constituent parts. Here we set out a framework for thinking about energy technology 'acceptance' that is relatively neutral in normative and theoretical terms, while acknowledging that a full integration of perspectives and complete theoretical neutrality are not possible. We do not claim a comprehensive review base, but draw on our experience to illustrate the diversity of what we regard as the more influential perspectives in the literature. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Drawing from survey responses of 1077 professional engineers and geoscientists, we reconstruct their framings of the issue and knowledge claims to position themselves within their organizational and their professional institutions. In understanding the struggle over what constitutes and legitimizes expertise, we make apparent the heterogeneity of claims, legitimation strategies, and use of emotionality and metaphor. By linking notions of the science or science fiction of climate change to the assessment of the adequacy of global and local policies and of potential organizational responses, we contribute to the understanding of 'defensive institutional work' by professionals within petroleum companies, related industries, government regulators, and their professional association.","[Lefsrud, Lianne M.] Univ Alberta, Alberta Sch Business, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R6, Canada; [Meyer, Renate E.] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Vienna, Austria; [Meyer, Renate E.] Copenhagen Business Sch, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Alberta; Vienna University of Economics & Business; Copenhagen Business School,"Lefsrud, LM (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Alberta Sch Business, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R6, Canada.",lefsrud@ualberta.ca,,,,,,,115,166,182,2,106,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0170-8406,1741-3044,,ORGAN STUD,Organ.

In two studies, we find that inaccurate perceptions of others' opinions (i.e. pluralistic ignorance) contribute to self-silencing among those concerned about climate change. Study 1 illustrates that those who are aware of others' concern about climate change report greater willingness to discuss the issue than those with inaccurate perceptions of others' opinions. Study 2 demonstrates that correcting pluralistic ignorance increases concerned participants' willingness to discuss climate change. In both studies, pluralistic ignorance leads to self-silencing because perceptions that others do not share one's opinion are associated with expecting to be perceived as less competent in a conversation about climate change. In contrast to previous research on confronting prejudice, in the present research expectations about being disliked did not explain self-silencing. We discuss the implications for self silencing and promoting interpersonal communication about climate change. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Newspaper articles may lack accuracy, while the severity of findings in scientific papers may be too opaque for the public to understand. Social media, however, is a forum where individuals of diverse backgrounds can share their thoughts and opinions. As consumption shifts from old media to new, Twitter has become a valuable resource for analyzing current events and headline news. In this research, we analyze tweets containing the word climate collected between September 2008 and July 2014. Through use of a previously developed sentiment measurement tool called the Hedonometer, we determine how collective sentiment varies in response to climate change news, events, and natural disasters. We find that natural disasters, climate bills, and oil-drilling can contribute to a decrease in happiness while climate rallies, a book release, and a green ideas contest can contribute to an increase in happiness. Words uncovered by our analysis suggest that responses to climate change news are predominately from climate change activists rather than climate change deniers, indicating that Twitter is a valuable resource for the spread of climate change awareness.","[Cody, Emily M.; Reagan, Andrew J.; Dodds, Peter Sheridan; Danforth, Christopher M.] Univ Vermont, Computat Story Lab, Burlington, VT 05401 USA; [Cody, Emily M.; Reagan, Andrew J.; Dodds, Peter Sheridan; Danforth, Christopher M.] Univ Vermont, Vermont Complex Syst Ctr, Burlington, VT 05401 USA; [Cody, Emily M.; Reagan, Andrew J.; Dodds, Peter Sheridan; Danforth, Christopher M.] Univ Vermont, Dept Math & Stat, Burlington, VT 05401 USA; [Mitchell, Lewis] Univ Adelaide, Sch Math Sci, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia",University of Vermont; University of Vermont; University of Vermont; University of Adelaide,"Cody, EM (corresponding author), 16 Colchester Ave, Burlington, VT 05401 USA.",Emily.Cody@uvm.edu,"Mitchell, Lewis/U-8250-2019; Dodds, Peter/C-9119-2014","Mitchell, Lewis/0000-0001-8191-1997; Dodds, Peter/0000-0003-1973-8614","National Science Foundation (NSF) grant [DMS-0940271]; NSF CAREER Award [0846668]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0846668] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division Of Mathematical Sciences; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien [0940271] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation (NSF) grant(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF CAREER Award(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Division Of Mathematical Sciences; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS))","The authors are grateful for the computational resources provided by the Vermont Advanced Computing Core which is supported by the Vermont Complex Systems Center.

We model social and political background, value orientations and the influence of CO2 emissions per capita and vulnerability to climate change upon climate scepticism, drawing upon data from the International Social Survey Programme. Substantial differences in the levels of climate scepticism are apparent between nations. Yet cross national data show that climate sceptics are not merely the mirror image of environmentalists. Typical predictors of environmental issue concern, such as education level, postmaterial value orientations and age are poor predictors of climate scepticism. Affiliation with conservative political parties, gender, being unconcerned about 'the environment' or having little trust in government are consistent predictors of scepticism. Climate change scepticism is also correlated positively with CO2 emissions and vulnerability to climate change. While high levels of scepticism have been documented among citizens of the United States, scepticism is as high or higher in countries such as Australia, Norway and New Zealand.

We argue that such claims may oversimplify in ways that lead to empirical inaccuracies. The Anti-Reflexivity Thesis suggests a more nuanced examination of how political ideology influences views about science. The Anti-Reflexivity Thesis hypothesizes that some sectors of society mobilize to defend the industrial capitalist order from the claims of environmentalists and some environmental scientists that the current economic system causes serious ecological and public health problems. The Anti-Reflexivity Thesis expects that conservatives will report significantly less trust in, and support for, science that identifies environmental and public health impacts of economic production (i.e., impact science) than liberals. It also expects that conservatives will report a similar or greater level of trust in, and support for, science that provides new inventions or innovations for economic production (i.e., production science) than liberals. Analyzing data from a recent survey experiment with 798 adults recruited from the US general public, our results confirm the expectations of the Anti-Reflexivity Thesis. Conservatives report less trust in impact scientists but greater trust in production scientists than their liberal counterparts. We argue that further work that increases the accuracy and depth of our understanding of the relationship between political ideology and views about science is likely crucial for addressing the politicized science-based issues of our age.","[McCright, Aaron M.] Michigan State Univ, Lyman Briggs Coll, Dept Sociol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [McCright, Aaron M.; Dietz, Thomas] Michigan State Univ, Environm Sci & Policy Program, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Dentzman, Katherine; Charters, Meghan] Michigan State Univ, Dept Sociol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Dietz, Thomas] Michigan State Univ, Dept Sociol, Anim Studies Program, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University; Michigan State University; Michigan State University; Michigan State University,"McCright, AM (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Lyman Briggs Coll, Dept Sociol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",mccright@msu.edu,"McCright, Aaron Matthew/Z-1967-2019","Dietz, Thomas/0000-0001-9399-0784","National Science Foundation [SES-1123762]; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Program Office [NA10OAR4310213]; Great Lakes Integrated Sciences and Assessments (GLISA) Center at Michigan State University; University of Michigan; Michigan State University AgBio Research; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1123762] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Program Office(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Great Lakes Integrated Sciences and Assessments (GLISA) Center at Michigan State University; University of Michigan(University of Michigan System); Michigan State University AgBio Research; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","This work was supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation (SES-1123762), by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Program Office through Grant NA10OAR4310213 with the Great Lakes Integrated Sciences and Assessments (GLISA) Center at Michigan State University and the University of Michigan, and by Michigan State University AgBio Research.",,76,149,167,4,72,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

Do informational or partisan components of elite cues dominate? Recent survey experiments offer conflicting insights. We argue that issue context matters, and that the single-issue nature of most survey experiments masks systematic variation in how elite cues affect attitudes across international issues. These effects depend on the baseline distribution of mass opinion on the issues themselves. Two characteristics of underlying opinion prove crucial: first, the share of those not aligned with expert opinion, and second, the degree of partisan polarization. Where polarization is limited, information effects should dominate. Where issues are polarized, information intake should be limited by partisan attribution. We test these hypotheses using nine survey experiments across a range of issues, including the rise of China, climate change, international institutions, and the use of force. At one extreme, all messages-even those endorsed by generic or opposition experts-can shift opinion; at the other, only partisan-attributed messages matter. Our findings are important not only for understanding public opinion about international issues but also for those interested in mobilizing opinion in a democratic setting.","[Guisinger, Alexandra] Temple Univ, Polit Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Saunders, Elizabeth N.] George Washington Univ, Polit Sci & Int Affairs, Washington, DC 20052 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University; George Washington University,"Guisinger, A (corresponding author), Temple Univ, Polit Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",,,"Saunders, Elizabeth/0000-0001-5350-0138","National Science Foundation [1225750]; Rooney Center for the Study of American Democracy at the University of Notre Dame; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1225750] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Rooney Center for the Study of American Democracy at the University of Notre Dame; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","For helpful comments and assistance, we thank Adam Berinsky, David Campbell, Joanne Gowa, Danny Hayes, Dan Hopkins, Richard Herrmann, Ole Holsti, Michael Horowitz, Josh Kertzer, Eric Lawrence, David Nickerson, Joseph O'Mahoney, John Sides, Rachel Stein, and Geoff Wallace, as well as the ISQ editors, and participants at the 2013 Annual Meeting of the American Political Science Association, the 2014 Annual Meeting of the International Studies Association, and the 2014 Survey Experiments in Peace Science Workshop at the University of Pennsylvania.

Overall the results tend to support those of the small-scale but in-depth studies on which the present study built: Lay publics in these six nations see global warming as a problem, although not as serious as ozone depletion or rain forest destruction. Most people acknowledge that they do not understand global warming very well, and results from questions about the perceived causes and consequences of global warming illustrate their limited understanding. While often confusing global warming with ozone depletion and air pollution, majorities of respondents in all but Russia believe that it is already occurring and large majorities within all nations believe that it will occur within their lifetimes. Furthermore, as discussions of the 'risk society' suggest, public perceptions of global warming do not vary consistently across differing social strata within the nations. The article ends by discussing implications of the results, and questions whether detailed public understanding of highly complex issues Like global warming is feasible or even necessary for effective policy-making.","Washington State Univ, Dept Sociol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA",Washington State University,"Washington State Univ, Dept Sociol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",dunlap@wsu.edu,"Dunlap, Riley E./Z-1676-2019","Dunlap, Riley E./0000-0002-7047-3757",,,,,67,148,184,1,59,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0268-5809,1461-7242,,INT SOCIOL,Int.

To examine the effect of this campaign and the debate it sparked, vie conducted two national surveys, one immediately before and the other immediately after the campaign. We addressed three questions: (1) What were Americans' beliefs and attitudes about global warming before the debate? (2) Did the debate catch the public's attention? and (3) Did the debate change people's beliefs and attitudes about global warming? We found that a majority Of the American general public and of the global warming issue public endorsed the views advocated by President Clinton before the media campaign began. The debate did attract people's attention and strengthened the public's beliefs and attitudes. The debate produced almost no changes in public opinion when the nation's population is lumped together. But beneath this apparently calm surface, strong Democrats came to endorse the positions advocated by the Clinton administration, while strong Republicans were less inclined to endorse the administration's views.","Ohio State Univ, Dept Psychol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; Princeton Univ, Dept Psychol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Princeton University; Princeton University,"Krosnick, JA (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Dept Psychol, 1885 Neil Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",,"Krosnick, Jon/JFB-2028-2023",,,,,,49,145,147,1,24,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",0963-6625,,,PUBLIC UNDERST SCI,Public Underst.

The data show that a large majority of the public in all countries are concerned about the problem of global warming and that this assessment is part of a broader concern for global environmental issues. The widespread concern implies that global warming has the potential to generate mass political participation and demand for political action. Motivated by a value-based approach to the study of public opinion, the article shows that perception of the seriousness of the problem is positively correlated with high education, post-materialism, and a leftist position on the left-right scale. In addition, religious beliefs are important, suggesting that there is some diversity in the value basis for the issue and that it is not only linked to the 'new-politics' perspective. Variation across nations in wealth and CO2 emissions is not significantly related to the publics' assessments of the problem, and, somewhat counterintuitively, people from countries relatively more exposed to climate-related natural disasters are less concerned about global warming. We suggest possible explanations for the latter finding and discuss our results in relation to the broader literature on environmental change, insecurity, and the potential for conflict.","[Kvaloy, Berit] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Sociol & Polit Sci, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway; [Finseraas, Henning] Norwegian Social Res, Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Kvaloy, B (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Sociol & Polit Sci, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway.",berit.kvaloy@tns-gallup.no,"Rauf, Abdul/D-5878-2011",,,,,,39,144,162,2,70,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0022-3433,1460-3578,,J PEACE RES,J.

In an Information-Choice Questionnaire (ICQ), a representative sample of the Dutch public (n = 995) was provided with all information on attributes of six CCS options, which experts deemed necessary to come to well-considered and well-informed opinions. A traditional questionnaire was used simultaneously (n = 327) to study uninformed evaluations of these technologies. The results showed that the Dutch public is mostly unaware of CCS and has little knowledge about how current energy use causes global warming. Uninformed respondents are still inclined to give their opinion however, which results in unpredictive, easily changeable opinions. ICQ respondents who processed information on attributes of CCS options were likely to base their option evaluations on this information, though not entirely. All in all, the results of the ICQ suggest that, after processing information deemed necessary by experts, Dutch people reluctantly agree with large scale implementation of each of the six CCS options.

J,"Lockwood, M",The political sustainability of climate policy: The case of the UK Climate Change Act,GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Climate change; Climate policy; Public opinion; Politics; UK,PUBLIC-OPINION; GOVERNMENT,"This paper assesses the forces working for and against the political sustainability of the UK 2008 Climate Change Act. The adoption of the Act is seen as a landmark commitment to action on climate change, but its implementation has not been studied in any depth. Recent events, including disagreements over the fourth carbon budget and the decarbonisation of the electricity sector, shows that while the Act might appear to lock in a commitment to reducing emissions through legal means, this does not guarantee political lock-in. The assumption, made by some proponents of the Act, that accountability of political leaders to a public concerned about climate change, via Parliament, would provide the main political underpinning to the Act is criticised. An analysis of alternative sources of political durability is presented, drawing on a framework for understanding the sustainability of reform developed by Patashnik. It is argued that the Act has helped create major institutional transformations, although the degree to which new institutions have displaced the power of existing ones is limited. The Act has produced some policy feedback effects, especially in the business community, and some limited investment effects, but both have been insufficient to withstand destabilisation by recent party political conflicts. The Climate Change Act remains at risk. (C) 2013 The Author. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

It thus matters that these perceptions are driven by factors other than the economy, including media coverage. We nevertheless know little about how media reflect economic trends, and whether they influence (or are influenced by) public economic perceptions. This article explores the economy, media, and public opinion, focusing in particular on whether media coverage and the public react to changes in or levels of economic activity, and the past, present, or future economy. Analyses rely on content-analytic data drawn from 30,000 news stories over 30 years in the United States. Results indicate that coverage reflects change in the future economy, and that this both influences and is influenced by public evaluations. These patterns make more understandable the somewhat surprising finding of positive coverage and public assessments in the midst of the Great Recession. They also may help explain previous findings in political behavior.","[Soroka, Stuart N.] Univ Michigan, Commun Studies & Polit Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Soroka, Stuart N.] Univ Michigan, Inst Social Res, Ctr Polit Studies, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Stecula, Dominik A.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Polit Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada; [Wlezien, Christopher] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Govt, Govt, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of British Columbia; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Soroka, SN (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Commun Studies & Polit Sci, 5370 North Quad,105 South State St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",ssoroka@umich.edu; d.stecula@alumni.ubc.ca; wlezien@austin.utexas.edu,"Wlezien, Christopher/L-4043-2019; Soroka, Stuart/N-6501-2019","Stecula, Dominik/0000-0001-6724-7559","Fonds de recherche sur la societe et la culture, Quebec, Canada","Fonds de recherche sur la societe et la culture, Quebec, Canada","Previous versions of this article were presented at the 68th Annual Conference of the American Association for Public Opinion Research, Boston, May 2013, and the 71st Annual Conference of the Midwest Political Science Association, Chicago, April 2013.

Given that ordinary citizens cannot directly assess such reasoning, does this call the democratic legitimacy of technical public policies in question? It does not, provided citizens can make reliable second-order assessments of the consensus of trustworthy scientific experts. I develop criteria for lay assessment of scientific testimony and demonstrate, in the case of claims about anthropogenic global warming, that applying such criteria is easy for anyone of ordinary education with access to the Web.

This study uses a cultural theory framework and focus groups conducted in the South West UK to develop deeper understandings of how individuals' worldviews can inform opinions and behaviour in relation to RE. These findings are used to explore ways in which government policies on RE might be tailored to engender greater public support and participation.

Ceteris paribus, the support base of environmental concerns is generally much stronger among Labor and Green supporters, postmaterialists, those who engage in eastern spiritual practices and professionals. Women are more likely than men to favour environmental protection over economic growth, to pay extra tax to protect the environment and to believe global warming will pose a serious threat during their lifetime. Support for renewable energy is stronger among younger Australians, suggesting demand may increase with generational replacement. Political leaders influence public concerns over global warming and other environmental issues across the partisan divide, yet while political elites remain divided over the implications of climatic change, the shift in public opinion and behaviour necessary to avert such problems is unlikely to occur.","Univ Tasmania, Sch Sociol & Social Work, Hobart, Tas, Australia",University of Tasmania,"Tranter, B (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Sch Sociol & Social Work, Hobart, Tas, Australia.",bruce.tranter@utas.edu.au,"Tranter, Bruce/J-6818-2014","Tranter, Bruce/0000-0002-0649-6065",,,,,52,128,135,4,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-4016,1743-8934,,ENVIRON POLIT,Environ.

In this article we examine the causes of both belief and disbelief in global warming among adult Americans. Methods. We use national- and state-level telephone surveys to collect data on individual-level beliefs regarding climate change and employ ordered logistical regression to measures the relative effect of various factors on those beliefs. Results. The study finds that U.S. views on climate change are being shaped by a combination of personal observations, meteorological events, and physical changes on the planet. The impact of various factors on one's belief in global warming are significantly determined by partisan affiliation, with Democrats and Republicans responding differently to assorted types of evidence. Conclusion. Beliefs regarding global warming are being shaped by individual experiences and weather phenomenon and the processing of such factors is substantially influenced by a person's partisan leanings.","[Borick, Christopher P.] Muhlenberg Coll, Dept Sci, Allentown, PA 18104 USA; [Rabe, Barry G.] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Borick, CP (corresponding author), Muhlenberg Coll, Dept Sci, 2400 W Chew St, Allentown, PA 18104 USA.",cborick@muhlenberg.edu,,,,,,,37,128,165,0,49,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4941,1540-6237,,SOC SCI QUART,Soc.

Regression analysis of,data from a fall 2013 national telephone survey of United States residents reveals that as respondents' geographic distance from areas experiencing significant development increases, political ideology becomes more strongly associated with issue support, with the liberal-partisan divide widening. Our findings support construal level theory's central premise: that people use more abstract considerations (like political ideology) the more geographically removed they are from an issue.

The data allow us to analyze the relationships between reasons provided by respondents, social psychological and demographic characteristics, and policy support. This analysis can provide policymakers pragmatic guidance in (1) developing tactics to engage the public that build on current concerns about climate change policies and (2) crafting and communicating policies that garner support from various segments of the public. This analysis also raises theoretical questions regarding the relationship between public discourse on environmental issues and the formation of public policy support. We suggest that future efforts to understand the U.S. dynamics of public support for climate change policies could benefit from understanding the public discursive and the reasoning processes that underlie public opinion formation.

Research on frame building is less well developed. In particular, journalists' contributions to shaping the frames in the news deserve further analysis. This article conceptualizes these contributions to creating news frames: Journalistic framing practices are situated on a continuum between frame setting and frame sending. Journalists frame their articles more or less in line with their own interpretations. The challenge for research is to identify the conditions that determine the degree of journalistic frame setting. The article therefore identifies mechanisms and factors that play a role in determining to what degree journalistic frame enactment takes place.","Univ Zurich, Inst Mass Commun & Media Res, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Brüggemann, M (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Inst Mass Commun & Media Res, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.",michael@bruegge.net,,,,,,,74,123,153,3,97,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1050-3293,1468-2885,,COMMUN THEOR,Commun.

How will individual experiences with these weather trends shape climate change beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors? In this article, we review 73 papers that have studied the relationship between climate change experiences and public opinion. Overall, we find mixed evidence that weather shapes climate opinions. Although there is some support for a weak effect of local temperature and extreme weather events on climate opinion, the heterogeneity of independent variables, dependent variables, study populations, and research designs complicate systematic comparison. To advance research on this critical topic, we suggest that future studies pay careful attention to differences between self-reported and objective weather data, causal identification, and the presence of spatial autocorrelation in weather and climate data. Refining research designs and methods in future studies will help us understand the discrepancies in results, and allow better detection of effects, which have important practical implications for climate communication. As the global population increasingly experiences weather conditions outside the range of historical experience, researchers, communicators, and policymakers need to understand how these experiences shape-and are shaped by-public opinions and behaviors.","[Howe, Peter D.; Shield, Brittany S.] Utah State Univ, Dept Environm & Soc, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Marlon, Jennifer R.] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Mildenberger, Matto] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Polit Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; Yale University; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Howe, PD (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Dept Environm & Soc, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",peter.howe@usu.edu,,"Harris, Brittany/0000-0001-7644-9726",National Science Foundation [BCS-1753082],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),We thank Parrish Bergquist and Anthony Leiserowitz for comments in development of the paper.

Twitter, in particular, allows for the evaluation of public opinion across both time and space because geotagged tweets include timestamps and geographic coordinates (latitude/longitude). In this study, a large dataset of geotagged tweets containing certain keywords relating to climate change is analyzed using volume analysis and text mining techniques such as topic modeling and sentiment analysis. Latent Dirichlet allocation was applied for topic modeling to infer the different topics of discussion, and Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner was applied for sentiment analysis to determine the overall feelings and attitudes found in the dataset. These techniques are used to compare and contrast the nature of climate change discussion between different countries and over time. Sentiment analysis shows that the overall discussion is negative, especially when users are reacting to political or extreme weather events. Topic modeling shows that the different topics of discussion on climate change are diverse, but some topics are more prevalent than others. In particular, the discussion of climate change in the USA is less focused on policy-related topics than other countries.","[Dahal, Biraj] Clemson Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Clemson, SC USA; [Dahal, Biraj] Clemson Univ, Dept Math Sci, Clemson, SC USA; [Kumar, Sathish A.

In these experiments, slightly over 2,000 respondents are asked to organize concepts presented in one of three culturally nuanced stories about climate change or where information is presented as a list. Hierarchical cluster analysis indicates that when respondents are exposed to culturally congruent stories, respondent organizational patterns are more likely to mirror the story.

Knowing how the level of interest in conservation topics-approximated using Google search volume-varies over time can help support targeted conservation science communication. However, the evolution of search volume over time and the mechanisms that drive peaks in searches are poorly understood. We conducted time series analyses on Google search data from 2004 to 2013 to investigate: (i) whether interests in selected conservation topics have declined and (ii) the effect of news reporting and academic publishing on search volume. Although trends were sensitive to the term used as benchmark, we did not find that public interest towards conservation topics such as climate change, ecosystem services, deforestation, orangutan, invasive species and habitat loss was declining. We found, however, a robust downward trend for endangered species and an upward trend for ecosystem services. The quantity of news articles was related to patterns in Google search volume, whereas the number of research articles was not a good predictor but lagged behind Google search volume, indicating the role of news in the transfer of conservation science to the public.","[Nghiem, Le T.

Specifically, we explore how two commonly used terms to describe this issue - fracking or shale oil or gas development - serve as issue frames and influence public opinion. Extending existing research, we suggest that these frames elicit different top-of-mind associations that reflect positive or negative connotations and resonate with people's political ideology. These associations, in turn, help explain direct and indirect framing effects on support/opposition as well as whether these effects differ by political ideology. Results of a split-ballot, national U.S. survey (n=1000) reveal that people are more supportive of the energy extraction process when it is referred to as shale oil or gas development versus fracking, and this relationship is mediated by greater perceptions of benefit versus risk. Political ideology did hot moderate these effects. Further analysis suggests that these findings are partly explained by the tendency to associate frocking more with negative thoughts and impacts and shale oil or gas development more with positive thoughts and impacts.

This paper describes an extensive study on the acceptance of CCS by stakeholders in the Netherlands and explores one of the determining factors in the acceptance of CCS by the lay public, i.e. the way the Dutch press perceives and portrays CCS. The stakeholder analysis shows that there is a positive attitude towards CCS by industry, government, and environmental NGOs, provided that the conditions they pose on the deployment of CCS are met. The content analysis of Dutch news articles conveys that the media portrayal of CCS is-to a certain extent-a balanced reflection of the way CCS is perceived by the stakeholders. Both analyses show that the concerns about CCS have not overshadowed the main promise that CCS is part of the solution to climate change. However, the current negative aspects of CCS as raised by different stakeholders and the media will remain if no action is taken. Therefore, the conditions posed on the use of CCS, as well as the actions required to meet these conditions, could function as a proxy for the, 'societal voice', articulating the most important issues concerning the future acceptance of CCS technology.

The nuclear option has to face not only the public opinion sensibility, mainly related to plant safety and waste disposal issues, but also the economic evaluation from investors and utilities, particularly careful on that energy source and in deregulated markets. Smaller size nuclear reactors (IAEA defines as small those reactors with power<300 MWe and medium with power<700 MWe) can represent a viable solution for both the stakeholders, especially for developing countries, or countries with not-highly-infrastructured and interconnected grids, or even for developed countries when limitation on capital at risk applies. A description of Small-Medium size Reactor (SMR) economic features is presented, in a comparison with the state-of-the-art Large size Reactors. A preliminary evaluation of the capital and O&M costs shows that the negative effects of the economies of scale can be balanced by the integral and modular design strategy of SMRs.

Offshore wind power has existed for some time in Europe, in the USA, its development has been hampered by opponents of the Cape Wind project off of Massachusetts. At present, the developer of the proposed Cape Wind project and a second developer proposing a project off of Delaware each strive to erect the first offshore wind power project in the Americas. Here, we examine public opinion. We first provide background on the case studies, then a review of prior studies of support and opposition of wind power projects in order to place the mail surveys within the context of the wider literature. After detailing the methods employed, we analyse the results and provide insights into the similarities and dis-similarities that are revealed in the data, with the intent of gaining a broader understanding of how individuals think about offshore wind power. The strikingly higher public support for offshore wind development in the mid-Atlantic, and especially off Delaware, suggests the possibility of substantially higher US public acceptance of offshore wind power than previously anticipated. Moreover, when offshore wind power is seen as transformative, we find substantial support even for residents near the first developments-residents who thus inherently take more risk. Potentially increasing acceptance of wind power, we argue, portends the shape of things to come.

We offer the first comprehensive examination of the distribution and content of second-order climate beliefs in the United States and China, drawing from six new opinion surveys of mass publics, political elites and intellectual elites. We demonstrate that all classes of political actors have second-order beliefs characterized by egocentric bias and global underestimation of pro-climate positions. We then demonstrate experimentally that individual support for pro-climate policies increases after respondents update their second-order beliefs.

On the one hand, the unequal distribution of power and interests can serve as a barrier to implementing coherent policy at a federal level. On the other, these features also enable policy leadership among sub-federal units. In the context of wide variation in climate policy at both national and sub-federal levels in Canada and in the United States, this paper utilizes an original data set to examine public attitudes and perceptions toward climate science and climate change policy in two federal systems. Drawing on national and provincial/state level data from telephone surveys administered in the United States and in Canada, the paper provides insight into where the public stands on the climate change issue in two of the most carbon-intensive federal systems in the world. The paper includes the first directly comparable public opinion data on how Canadians and Americans form their opinions regarding climate matters and provides insight into the preferences of these two populations regarding climate policies at both the national and sub-federal levels. Key findings are examined in the context of growing policy experiments at the sub-federal level in both countries and limited national level progress in the adoption of climate change legislation.","[Lachapelle, Erick] Univ Montreal, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Borick, Christopher P.] Muhlenberg Coll, Muhlenberg Inst Publ Opin, Allentown, PA USA; [Rabe, Barry] Univ Michigan, Gerald R Ford Sch Publ Policy, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Universite de Montreal; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Lachapelle, E (corresponding author), Univ Montreal, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada.",,"Lachapelle, Erick/AAI-1449-2021","Lachapelle, Erick/0000-0002-0808-0688",,,,,51,112,123,1,69,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1541-132X,1541-1338,,REV POLICY RES,Rev.

Using an experimental design, we examine the influence of frames presenting local versus global climate impacts and frames discussing projected losses versus those also discussing possible benefits of climate change, on individual perceptions of the severity of climate change, behavioral intentions to address climate change, and attitudes toward climate change policies. The results indicate that our impact frames influence public opinion, although the effects sometimes differ based on individuals' partisan predispositions. Specifically, our study shows that local frames increase perceptions of the severity of the problem and support for local (sub-national) policy action for all subjects, as well as behavioral intentions for subjects who are Independents or Republicans. Presenting subjects with information on the potential benefits and losses of climate change weakens perceptions of problem severity for all subjects at the local and national level, decreases support for local policy action among Democrats, and has no effect on behavioral intentions. Overall, these results are consistent with policy research suggesting that perceptions of local vulnerability are an important factor in the adoption of sub-national climate change policies. The findings also imply that the effectiveness of particular climate change impact frames will vary from one state to another depending on a state's partisan leanings. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, such taxes are politically challenging to introduce, as public opinion is usually hostile to them. Prior studies have found that attitudes toward carbon and other environmental taxes reflect not just peoples beliefs and concerns about the problems these taxes address, but also their trust in their country's politicians and political system. Using multilevel models fitted to data collected in 2016 on 42,401 individuals in 23 European countries, we show for the first time that these two factors interact. Among Europeans who distrust their country's politicians, political parties, and parliament, or who live in countries with low levels of political trust, being aware and concerned about climate change is at most weakly associated with support for taxes on fossil fuels. Europeans with high political trust, on the other hand, tend to be much more supportive of fossil fuel taxes if they also believe in the reality and dangers of anthropogenic climate change. Cross-nationally, the nations whose populations are most supportive of higher taxes on fossil fuels are not those that are more aware and concerned about climate change; rather, they are those with the highest levels of political trust.","[Fairbrother, Malcolm; Seva, Ingemar Johansson; Kulin, Joakim] Umea Univ, Dept Sociol, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Fairbrother, Malcolm] Inst Futures Studies, Stockholm, Sweden; [Fairbrother, Malcolm] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Dept Sociol, Graz, Austria",Umea University; University of Graz,"Fairbrother, M (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Sociol, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden.",malcolm.fairbrother@umu.se,"Fairbrother, Malcolm/F-9599-2013","Fairbrother, Malcolm/0000-0002-1400-2141; Johansson Seva, Ingemar/0000-0003-3349-5778; Kulin, Joakim/0000-0002-7610-9104",Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg Foundation [2014.0034]; Swedish Research Council [2018-01531]; Riksbankens Jubileumsfond [NHS14-2035:1]; Swedish Research Council [2018-01531] Funding Source: Swedish Research Council; Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences [NHS14-2035:1] Funding Source: Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences; Vinnova [2018-01531] Funding Source: Vinnova,Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg Foundation; Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council); Riksbankens Jubileumsfond(Swedish Foundation for Humanities & Social Sciences); Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council); Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences(Swedish Foundation for Humanities & Social Sciences); Vinnova(Vinnova),"For useful feedback on the arguments presented in this article, the authors thank audiences at Gothenburg University, the Institute for Futures Studies, the 14th Nordic Environmental Social Science Conference, and three anonymous GEC reviewers.

Mail surveys were conducted in the German-speaking part of Switzerland. The first survey took place before the accident in Fukushima (Autumn 2010), the second survey immediately after the accident (March 2011), and the third survey half a year after the accident (October 2011). A sample of 463 persons participated in all three surveys. The accident had a negative impact on the acceptance of nuclear power. The mean change was moderate, and high correlations between the measurement points were observed. Overall, participants thus showed rather stable attitudes towards nuclear power across the three measurement waves. Results of the present study demonstrate the importance of prior beliefs and attitudes for the interpretation of an accident. The evaluation of the various scenarios was strongly influenced by participants' pre-Fukushima attitudes towards nuclear power. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We conducted a randomized controlled experiment to test public reactions to six different advocacy statements made by a scientist-ranging from a purely informational statement to an endorsement of specific policies. We found that perceived credibility of the communicating scientist was uniformly high in five of the six message conditions, suffering only when he advocated for a specific policy-building more nuclear power plants (although credibility did not suffer when advocating for a different specific policy-carbon dioxide limits at power plants). We also found no significant differences in trust in the broader climate science community between the six message conditions. Our results suggest that climate scientists who wish to engage in certain forms of advocacy have considerable latitude to do so without risking harm to their credibility, or the credibility of the scientific community.","[Kotcher, John E.; Myers, Teresa A.; Vraga, Emily K.; Maibach, Edward W.] George Mason Univ, Ctr Climate Change Commun, Dept Commun, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Stenhouse, Neil] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Life Sci Commun, Madison, WI USA",George Mason University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Kotcher, JE (corresponding author), George Mason Univ, Ctr Climate Change Commun, Dept Commun, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",jkotcher@gmu.edu,"Vraga, Emily/K-9325-2019; Kotcher, John/P-7866-2019; Maibach, Edward/A-7102-2009","Vraga, Emily/0000-0002-3016-3869; Kotcher, John/0000-0003-4789-1384; Maibach, Edward/0000-0003-3409-9187",National Aeronautics and Space Administration [NNX11AQ80G]; Energy Foundation [G-1504-23011]; Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment,National Aeronautics and Space Administration(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); Energy Foundation; Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment,"This research was supported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration [Award #: NNX11AQ80G], the Energy Foundation [Award #: G-1504-23011], and the Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment, none of which bear any responsibility for the findings and interpretations reported here.",,53,103,108,4,42,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1752-4032,1752-4040,,ENVIRON COMMUN,Environ.

Introducing the theoretical concept of relative sociotropic time horizons, the authors show that believers in Christian end-times theology are less likely to support policies designed to curb global warming than are other Americans. They then provide robustness checks by analyzing other policy attitudes. In so doing, the authors provide empirical evidence to suggest that citizens possessing shorter shadows of the future often resist policies trading short-term costs for hypothetical long-term benefits.","[Barker, David C.] Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Bearce, David H.] Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Barker, DC (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Polit Sci, 4813 W Posvar Hall, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",,,,,,,,45,103,124,1,37,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1065-9129,1938-274X,,POLIT RES QUART,Polit.

The Knowledge Deficit Model (KDM) suggests that experts have knowledge that the public does not and that this knowledge deficit makes it difficult for the public to evaluate risk properly. Recent studies of KDM have been unable to find evidence of this expectation. We believe these examinations may have incorrectly measured knowledge. There are two approaches to measuring the public's knowledge on an issue: (1) subjective perceptions of one's knowledge and (2) objective assessment of one's knowledge. Scientific knowledge, defined as one's assessed understanding of an issue, is very different from one's subjective, perceived knowledge. We examine individual risk perceptions of climate change to determine the extent to which measurement errors of knowledge may have affected previous studies of KDM. Our findings suggest that subjective measures of knowledge are poorly capturing scientific knowledge. Our findings also suggest that using scientific measures of knowledge produces results that support KDM. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent opinion polls show rising public awareness of climate change. Yet considerable cross-national variation exists in the intensity of public concern and in public willingness to pay for addressing climate change. Drawing on twelve multinational surveys, we examine two aggregate conditionsa country's affluence and its vulnerability to climate risksas key factors underlying cross-national differences in public support for and commitment to costly climate policies. In contrast to the post-materialism thesis, we find strong concern about climate change to be higher in developing countries. Contrary to expectation, climate vulnerability had little effect on public concern, but did have significant impact on some measures of personal commitment and support for climate policies. The analysis indicates that, in most countries examined, high concern about climate change is only beginning to translate into personal commitment to action.","[Kim, So Young] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Sci & Technol Policy, Taejon, South Korea; [Kim, So Young] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Sci & Technol Policy Program, Taejon, South Korea; [Wolinsky-Nahmias, Yael] Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST); Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST); University of Southern California,"Kim, SY (corresponding author), Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Sci & Technol Policy, Taejon, South Korea.",,"Kim, So Young/C-1674-2011",,,,,,46,100,105,1,43,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1526-3800,1536-0091,,GLOBAL ENVIRON POLIT,Glob.

While compelling, most studies focus on a narrow definition of political ideology in the US. This study adds to the literature by assessing the relationship between populism, climate skepticism, and support for environmental protection. Populism offers an orthogonal dimension to partisanship and left-right self-placement, which broadens the scope of the concept. Assessing the UK facilitates understanding the role of political ideology beyond the strong party sorting apparent in the US.

What are the key factors and to what extent do these factors shape individual Chinese environmental concern? Based on a micro-macro model and a county fixed model proposed in this study, we employ nationwide representative public opinion survey data and provincial statistics to examine the determinants and variations of public environmental concern in China. The data shows that environmental concern is not among the top-ranked issue concerns in China overall, but in the urban areas and in the east-coastal region environmental protection features as a rather important issue. Our regression analyses further demonstrate that the Chinese environmental concern is significantly affected by both micro-level socio-demographic variables and macro-level regional economic conditions and environmental risks. In the east-coastal region, such individuals as urbanites with high income are most environmentally concerned. There is a lack of concern over environmental issues among the public in the west region, where little association between individual sociodemographics and their environmental concern is detected. In the central-northeast region, education effect is evident in the rural area. Location contextual factors such as economic development and environmental risk account for most of the observed variations in public environment concern. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Serious ethical and societal concerns underline this astroturfing practice, especially if corporations are successful in influencing public opinion by undertaking a social movement approach. This study is motivated by this particular issue and examines the effectiveness of astroturf organizations in the global warming context, wherein large corporate polluters have an incentive to set up astroturf organizations to undermine the importance of human activities in climate change. We conduct an experiment to determine whether astroturf organizations have an impact on the level of user certainty about the causes of global warming. Results show that people who used astroturf websites became more uncertain about the causes of global warming and humans' role in the phenomenon than people who used grassroots websites. Astroturf organizations are hence successful in promoting business interests over environmental protection. In addition to the multiple business ethics issues it raises, astroturfing poses a significant threat to the legitimacy of the grassroots movement.","[Cho, Charles H.] ESSEC Business Sch, F-95021 Cergy Pontoise, France; [Martens, Martin L.] Vancouver Isl Univ, Fac Management, Nanaimo, BC V9R 5S5, Canada; [Kim, Hakkyun] Concordia Univ, Dept Mkt, John Molson Sch Business, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada; [Rodrigue, Michelle] Univ Laval, Ecole Comptabilite, Fac Sci Adm, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada",ESSEC Business School; Vancouver Island University; Concordia University - Canada; Laval University,"Cho, CH (corresponding author), ESSEC Business Sch, Ave Bernard Hirsch,BP 50105, F-95021 Cergy Pontoise, France.",cho@essec.edu; martin.martens@viu.ca; hkim@jmsb.concordia.ca; michelle.rodrigue@fsa.ulaval.ca,"Martens, Martin L/G-9630-2014; Rodrigue, Michelle/E-5238-2016","Martens, Martin L/0000-0002-0911-6603; Rodrigue, Michelle/0000-0003-4083-8505",,,,,78,95,108,2,65,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-4544,1573-0697,,J BUS ETHICS,J.

Although it has recently been rather extensively discussed, this discussion has rarely been connected to the extensive literature on pseudoscience and the science-pseudoscience demarcation. This contribution argues that science denialism should be seen as one of the two major forms of pseudoscience, alongside of pseudotheory promotion. A detailed comparison is made between three prominent forms of science denialism, namely relativity theory denialism, evolution denialism, and climate science denialism. Several characteristics are identified that distinguish science denialism from other forms of pseudoscience, in particular its persistent fabrication of fake controversies, the extraordinary male dominance among its activists, and its strong connection with various forms of right-wing politics. It is argued that the scientific response to science denialism has to be conceived with these characteristics in mind. In particular, it is important to expose the fabricated fake controversies for what they are and to reveal how science denialists consistently use deviant criteria of assent to distort the scientific process.

Probability sampling and a stratified technique were used to conduct a survey with subjects aged 20 years and over with higher education qualifications. The results showed that the majority of Malaysians are concerned about climate change and have heard about renewable energy. However, only two out of five people in Peninsular Malaysia have used renewable energy products. This finding can be explained by the high price of renewable energy products, lack of knowledge about government policies, and ineffective programs and initiatives. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

These problems, whether presumed or real, have negative implications for popular legitimacy of (i.e., public support for) global environmental governance. One of the most frequently proposed remedies, in this context, is greater involvement of civil society. Many academics and policy-makers claim that such involvement can increase transparency, strengthen representation of otherwise marginalized stakeholders, and provide knowledge to enhance problem-solving capacity. Skeptics challenge this claim, noting that civil society organizations are not accountable to voters and often represent narrowly defined interests. Assuming that public support for global environmental governance is ultimately important for its effectiveness, we evaluate the two competing claims by examining how civil society involvement affects public support for global environmental governance. We report on three survey experiments focusing on civil society involvement in global climate policy-making. Overall, the results speak in favor of civil society involvement. Our first survey experiment shows that individuals favor civil society involvement in global climate policy-making. The second and third experiments show that individuals pay more attention to changes of the status quo than to static conditions: popular legitimacy of global climate governance decreases when civil society is excluded, and increases when civil society is added. The latter finding has implications for current debates on how to address the persistent stalemate in global climate negotiations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Our sample of 3105 individuals in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom was recruited by survey firms that administer internet surveys to nationally representative population samples. Measured familiarity was higher than expected, with 8% and 45% of the population correctly defining the terms geoengineering and climate engineering respectively. There was strong support for allowing the study of SRM. Support decreased and uncertainty rose as subjects were asked about their support for using SRM immediately, or to stop a climate emergency. Support for SRM is associated with optimism about scientific research, a valuing of SRM's benefits and a stronger belief that SRM is natural, while opposition is associated with an attitude that nature should not be manipulated in this way. The potential risks of SRM are important drivers of public perception with the most salient being damage to the ozone layer and unknown risks. SRM is a new technology and public opinions are just forming; thus all reported results are sensitive to changes in framing, future information on risks and benefits, and changes to context.","[Mercer, A.

Data was collected through a questionnaire applied in Nikaia, an urban municipality of Greece. The respondents have a positive attitude towards renewable energy systems. Most of them have good knowledge of solar and wind energy systems and are using solar water heating, while several respondents own a solar PV system. Environmental protection is seen as the most important reason for investing in a renewable energy system. Willingness to pay for a wider penetration of RES into the electricity mix was estimated to be 26.5 euros per quarterly electricity bill. The statistical analysis revealed the existence of a relationship between RES perceived advantages and willingness to pay for renewable energy. Furthermore, by using a binary logit model, willingness to pay was found to be positively associated with education, energy subsidies, and state support.","[Ntanos, Stamatios; Arabatzis, Garyfallos; Skordoulis, Michalis] Democritus Univ Thrace, Sch Agr & Forestry Sci, Dept Forestry & Management Environm & Nat Resourc, Orestiada 68200, Greece; [Kyriakopoulos, Grigorios] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Zografos 15780, Greece; [Chalikias, Miltiadis] Piraeus Univ Appl Sci, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Business Adm, Aigaleo 12244, Greece",Democritus University of Thrace; National Technical University of Athens; University of West Attica,"Ntanos, S (corresponding author), Democritus Univ Thrace, Sch Agr & Forestry Sci, Dept Forestry & Management Environm & Nat Resourc, Orestiada 68200, Greece.",sdanos@ath.forthnet.gr; gregkyr@chemeng.ntua.gr; mchalikias@hotmail.com; garamp@fmenr.duth.gr; mskordoulis@gmail.com,"KYRIAKOPOULOS, GRIGORIOS L./A-5933-2008; Ntanos, Stamatios/J-2732-2019; Skordoulis, Michalis/AFK-9086-2022","KYRIAKOPOULOS, GRIGORIOS L./0000-0003-4875-8534; Ntanos, Stamatios/0000-0001-7718-1223; Skordoulis, Michalis/0000-0002-4621-507X",,,,,76,92,97,1,40,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAR,2018,10,3,,,,,,,687,10.3390/su10030687,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10030687,,,16,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GA8DA,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-06-14,WOS:000428567100114,View Full Record in Web of Science,,,,,,

We examine the extent to which Democrats, Republicans, and independents are likely to defer to scientific expertise in matters of policy. Our study draws on an October 2013 U.S. national survey of 2,000 respondents. We find that partisan differences exist: our data show that most Americans see science as relevant to policy, but that their willingness to defer to science in policy matters varies considerably across issues. While party, ideology, and religious beliefs clearly influence attitudes toward science, Republicans are not notably skeptical about accepting scientific recommendations. Rather, it seems that Democrats are particularly receptive to the advice and counsel of scientists, when compared to both independents and Republicans.","[Blank, Joshua M.] Texas Polit Project, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Shaw, Daron] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Blank, JM (corresponding author), Texas Polit Project, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",,,,,,,,11,92,108,2,37,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0002-7162,1552-3349,,ANN AM ACAD POLIT SS,Ann.

The lack of political science expertise and research represents an obstacle for adapting to climate change, because adaptation is fundamentally political. Technical advances in adaptations for infrastructure, agriculture, public health, coastal protection, conservation, and other fields all depend on political variables for their implementation and effectiveness. For example, adaptation raises questions about political economy (adaptation costs money), political theory (adaptation involves questions of social justice), comparative politics (some countries more aggressively pursue adaptation), urban politics (some cities more aggressively pursue adaptation), regime type (democracies and authoritarian regimes may differently pursue adaptation), federalism (different levels of government may be involved), and several other fields of study including political conflict, international development, bureaucracy, migration, media, political parties, elections, civil society, and public opinion. I review the field of climate change adaptation and then explore the tremendous contributions that political scientists could make to adaptation research.","Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA",University of Notre Dame,"Javeline, D (corresponding author), Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",javeline@nd.edu,,"Javeline, Debra/0000-0003-0847-8140",Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC); Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr [1029584] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC); Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)),,,94,92,111,1,78,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1537-5927,1541-0986,,PERSPECT POLIT,Perspect.

How can we address this disconnect between science and public opinion? In the present study, we investigated the role of metaphorical framing in shaping attitudes toward climate change. Participants read a brief article that metaphorically described US efforts to reduce carbon emissions as a war or race against climate change, or non-metaphorically described it as the issue of climate change. We further manipulated whether these emission-reduction goals emphasized the relatively near or distant future. We found that, compared to the race frame, the war metaphor made people perceive more urgency and risk surrounding climate change and express a greater willingness to increase conservation behavior, irrespective of the time horizon. Those who read the non-metaphorical report tended to respond in between these two extremes. We discuss the implications of these findings for climate communications.","[Flusberg, Stephen J.] SUNY Coll Purchase, Dept Psychol, Purchase, NY 10577 USA; [Matlock, Teenie] Univ Calif Merced, Cognit & Informat Sci Program, Merced, CA USA; [Matlock, Teenie] Univ Calif Merced, Ctr Climate Commun, Merced, CA USA; [Thibodeau, Paul H.] Oberlin Coll, Dept Psychol, Oberlin, OH 44074 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; University of California System; University of California Merced; University of California System; University of California Merced; University System of Ohio; Oberlin College,"Flusberg, SJ (corresponding author), SUNY Coll Purchase, Dept Psychol, Purchase, NY 10577 USA.",stephen.flusberg@purchase.edu,"Thibodeau, Paul/AAY-7259-2021",,"National Science Foundation [1534479]; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1534479] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",This research was supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation [1534479].,,58,91,107,1,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1752-4032,1752-4040,,ENVIRON COMMUN,Environ.

The present study explores whether conservatives' opposition to environmental protection is solely a U.S. or a universal phenomenon and whether this association is contingent on country-level characteristics, such as development, environmental conditions, and communist history. Employing data for 19 countries from the International Social Survey Program module Environment II, this article explores inter-country variations in the relationship between individual conservatism and environmental concern using multilevel modeling with cross-level interactions. The models reveal a number of intriguing associations. Most important, conservatives' support for environmental protection varies by country. This variation is a function of country-level characteristics. The strongest opposition of conservatives' toward environmental protection was observed in developed, capitalist nations, with superior environmental conditions. On the other hand, in less developed countries, and countries characterized by poor environmental quality, conservatives are more environmentally concerned than liberals.","Univ Colorado, Dept Sociol, Inst Behav Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Nawrotzki, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Sociol, Inst Behav Sci, Ketchum Hall 219,327, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",raphael.nawrotzki@colorado.edu,,,"NICHD NIH HHS [P2C HD066613, R24 HD066613] Funding Source: Medline",NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,67,90,100,0,84,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1086-0266,1552-7417,,ORGAN ENVIRON,Organ.

In this review, we assess the empirical literature on political misinformation in the United States and consider what scholars have learned since the publication of that early study. We conclude that research on this topic has developed unevenly. Over time, scholars have elaborated on the psychological origins of political misinformation, and this work has cumulated in a productive way. By contrast, although there is an extensive body of research on how to correct misinformation, this literature is less coherent in its recommendations. Finally, a nascent line of research asks whether people's reports of their factual beliefs are genuine or are instead a form of partisan cheer-leading.

In part, the Narrative Policy Framework (NPF) was developed to empirically test this assertion. To assess the relationship between policy narratives and public opinion, NPF posits several causal mechanisms including narrative transportation. Narrative transportation is a measure used to assess the extent to which individuals exposed to a story are transported into that story. NPF hypothesizes that as narrative transportation increases the reader of the story will (i) have more positive affect for characters within the story; and (ii) will find the story more persuasive. Using an online experiment involving a nationally representative sample of over 1,700 respondents, this research tests narrative transportation hypotheses by exposing subjects to one of three Cultural Theory narratives about climate change, as well as a control list of scientifically agreed upon facts. While findings do not support that narratives are any more transportive than fact lists in terms of directly persuading respondents to accept specific climate change policies, the data do show that narrative transportation positively influences affect for hero characters, which extant research demonstrates indirectly influences the persuasiveness of a story.","Oregon State Univ, Sch Publ Policy, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",Oregon State University,"Jones, MD (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Sch Publ Policy, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",,,"Jones, Michael/0000-0002-8377-732X",,,,,63,89,110,26,128,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0190-292X,1541-0072,,POLICY STUD J,Policy Stud.

One of the more interesting accounts, from a psychological perspective, is the influence of ideology on climate change beliefs. Previous work suggests that ideology trumps knowledge in shaping climate change beliefs. However, these studies have typically examined the influence of proxy measures of knowledge rather than specific climate change knowledge. The goal of the present research was to provide some clarification on the different influences of knowledge and ideology on beliefs about climate change. Specifically, we investigated the relationship between specific climate change knowledge, hierarchical and individualistic ideology, and climate change belief in a national sample (N = 335) of the Australian public. Contrary to research involving proxy knowledge measures, we found that people who had greater knowledge of climate change causes were more willing to accept that climate change is occurring. Furthermore, knowledge of causes attenuated the negative relationship between individualistic ideology and belief that climate change exists. Our findings suggest that climate change knowledge has the potential to positively influence public discourse on the issue.

We draw theoretical and analytical guidance from the identity-protective cognition thesis explaining the white male effect and from recent political psychology scholarship documenting the heightened system-justification tendencies of political conservatives. We utilize public opinion data from nine Gallup surveys between 2001 and 2010, focusing on both a single-item indicator and a composite measure of worry about environmental problems. We find that CWMs indeed have significantly lower worry about environmental problems than do other Americans. Furthermore, the results of our multivariate regression models reveal that this CWMs effect remains significant when controlling for the direct effects of political ideology, race, and gender and the effects of nine social, demographic, and temporal control variables as well as the effect of individuals generalized (nonenvironmental) risk perceptions. We conclude that the white male effect is due largely to CWMs, and that the latters low level of concern with environmental risks is likely driven by their social commitment to prevent new environmental regulations and repeal existing ones.","[McCright, Aaron M.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Sociol, Environm Sci & Policy Program, Lyman Briggs Coll, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Dunlap, Riley E.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Sociol, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA",Michigan State University; Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater,"McCright, AM (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Sociol, Environm Sci & Policy Program, Lyman Briggs Coll, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",mccright@msu.edu,"McCright, Aaron Matthew/Z-1967-2019; Dunlap, Riley E./Z-1676-2019","Dunlap, Riley E./0000-0002-7047-3757",,,,,42,87,110,0,69,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1366-9877,,,J RISK RES,J.

However, it still remains challenging to understand its determinants for the climate community. Here, we use a meta-analytic approach to examine the role of public opinion about climate change taxes and laws. Fifteen variables were examined by synthesizing 89 datasets from 51 articles across 33 countries, with a total sample of 119,465 participants. Among all factors, perceived fairness and effectiveness were the most important determinants. Self-enhancement values and knowledge about climate change showed weak relationships and demographic variables showed only weak or close to zero effects. Our meta-analytic results provide useful insights and have the potential to inform climate change researchers, practitioners and policymakers to better design climate policy instruments. Although public acceptance is essential for effective climate policies, the underlying drivers are still not well understood. Now, meta-analysis results show that perceived fairness and effectiveness have the strongest relationships with support for climate taxes and laws.","[Bergquist, Magnus; Nilsson, Andreas] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Psychol, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Harring, Niklas; Jagers, Sverker C.] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Polit Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg; University of Gothenburg,"Bergquist, M (corresponding author), Univ Gothenburg, Dept Psychol, Gothenburg, Sweden.",magnus.bergquist@psy.gu.se,"; Nilsson Hed, Andreas/U-3820-2017","Harring, Niklas/0000-0001-8690-1376; Nilsson Hed, Andreas/0000-0003-4055-0309",Kamprad Family Foundation [20200135]; Swedish Research Council Formas [2019-02005]; Formas [2019-02005] Funding Source: Formas,Kamprad Family Foundation; Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas); Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas),"We would like to thank all authors who made this meta-analysis possible by providing raw data or summarizing their data.

With 336 million active users as of 2018, Twitter is a social network that is increasingly used in research to get information and to understand public opinion as exemplified by Twitter users. In order to identify the factors related to the sustainable care of environment and public health, we have downloaded n = 5873 tweets that used the hashtag #WorldEnvironmentDay on the respective day. As the next step, sentiment analysis with an algorithm developed in Python and trained with data mining was applied to the sample of tweets to group them according to the expressed feelings. Thereafter, a textual analysis was used to group the tweets according to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), identifying the key factors about environment and public health that most concern Twitter users. To this end, we used the qualitative analysis software NVivo Pro 12. The results of the analysis enabled us to establish the key factors that most concern users about the environment and public health such as climate change, global warming, extreme weather, water pollution, deforestation, climate risks, acid rain or massive industrialization. The conclusions of the present study can be useful to companies and institutions that have initiatives related to the environment and they also facilitate decision-making regarding the environment in non-profit organizations. Our findings will also serve the United Nations that will thoroughly review the 17 SDGs at the High-level Political Forum in 2019.","[Reyes-Menendez, Ana; Ramon Saura, Jose] Rey Juan Carlos Univ, Dept Business Econ, Fac Social Sci & Law, Paseo Artilleros S-N, Madrid 28032, Spain; [Alvarez-Alonso, Cesar] Harvard Univ, Inst Global Law & Policy, Harvard Law Sch, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Universidad Rey Juan Carlos; Harvard University,"Saura, JR (corresponding author), Rey Juan Carlos Univ, Dept Business Econ, Fac Social Sci & Law, Paseo Artilleros S-N, Madrid 28032, Spain.",ana.reyes@urjc.es; joseramon.saura@urjc.es; calvarezalonso@law.harvard.edu,"Saura, José Ramón/L-2861-2018; Reyes-Menendez, Ana/U-7912-2019; Reyes-Menendez, Ana/X-5393-2018","Saura, José Ramón/0000-0002-9457-7745; Reyes-Menendez, Ana/0000-0003-0636-9573; Reyes-Menendez, Ana/0000-0003-0636-9573; ALVAREZ ALONSO, CESAR/0000-0002-2251-6062",,,,,75,86,92,5,66,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

There is, moreover, substantial variation in the degree to which democratic governments are willing to invest in long-term social goods. Surprisingly, the literature on the politics of public policy has paid little explicit attention to timing as a dimension of policy choice, focusing almost exclusively on matters of cross-sectional distribution. This article develops a framework for explaining intertemporal policy choices in democracies by adapting findings from the literatures on distributive politics, political economy, and political behavior. The article makes a case for analyzing the politics of the long term as a struggle over how welfare should be allocated across groups and over how policy effects should be distributed through time.","[Jacobs, Alan M.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Polit Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Jacobs, AM (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Polit Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada.",alan.jacobs@ubc.ca,,,,,,,128,86,95,3,40,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1094-2939,1545-1577,978-0-8243-3319-5,ANNU REV POLIT SCI,Annu.

Why? I show that this puzzling gap between the public's positive concerns and normative preferences is due substantially to a lack of trust, particularly political trust. In multilevel models fitted to two international survey datasets, trust strongly predicts support for environmental protection within countries and, by some measures, among countries also. An influential competing theory holds that environmental attitudes correlate mostly with left versus right political ideology; the results here, however, show that this correlation is weaker and varies substantially from country to country-unlike that with trust. Theoretically, these results reflect that environmental degradation is a collective action problem and environmental protection a public good. Methodologically, they derive from the more flexible application of multilevel modeling techniques than in previous studies using such models.","[Fairbrother, Malcolm] Univ Bristol, Ctr Multilevel Modelling, Cabot Inst, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol, Avon, England",University of Bristol,"Fairbrother, M (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Ctr Multilevel Modelling, Cabot Inst, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol, Avon, England.",ggmhf@bristol.ac.uk,"Fairbrother, Malcolm/F-9599-2013","Fairbrother, Malcolm/0000-0002-1400-2141",Riksbankens Jubileumsfonds (Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences) [NHS142035:1]; Institute for Advanced Studies at the University of Bristol,Riksbankens Jubileumsfonds (Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences); Institute for Advanced Studies at the University of Bristol,"The author thanks Diego Miralles, Laura De Vito, Jan Mewes, and Jonas Edlund for helpful comments on earlier versions of this article, and audiences at the Institute for Futures Studies (Stockholm), Umea University, Orebro University, Gothenburg University, Stockholm University, and the Institute for Social and Economic Research (Essex) for many constructive suggestions and criticisms.

The survey showed a majority of respondents (42%) willing to accept nuclear power if it would help tackle climate change. Following the disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Complex in Japan, an event triggered by the 11 March 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami, it was expected that support for nuclear power in Australia would change. In light of this, a follow-up survey was conducted in 2012. Indeed, the post-Fukushima results show a majority of respondents (40%) were not willing to accept nuclear power as an option to help tackle climate change, despite the fact that most Australians still believed nuclear power to offer a cleaner, more efficient option than coal, which currently dominates the domestic production of energy. Expanding the use of renewable energy sources (71%) remains the most popular option, followed by energy-efficient technologies (58%) and behavioural change (54%). Opposition to nuclear power will continue to be an obstacle against its future development even when posed as a viable solution to climate change. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, little is known about how consumers perceive, and how they might respond to the opportunities that smart grid technologies offer. This paper reports the results from a Hong Kong survey (n=505). It contributes to the literature by providing a better understanding of the perceptions and behaviour of electricity consumers about the possible deployment of smart grids. Our results indicate that Hong Kong consumers generally welcomed smart grid technologies and had a preference for energy saving, energy efficiency and renewable energy while they showed a high level of opposition to nuclear power. They displayed an interest in playing a much more informed and active role in energy decision-making, but they were sensitive to tariff increases. Motivations and barriers for consumers to support smart grid developments are also discussed. We conclude with a discussion of policy implications for effective consumer engagement. More policy attention is needed on demand-side measures, introducing institutional and regulatory changes, and modifying relationships between consumers, the government and utilities.

In this paper, we investigate whether citizens in the United States and 25 other countries support reciprocity to deal with climate change. We find little public enthusiasm for intrinsic reciprocity, in which countries restrain their consumption of fossil fuels if and only if other countries do the same. In contrast, we find significant support for extrinsic reciprocity, in which countries enforce cooperation by linking issues. Citizens support economic sanctions against polluters and are willing to shame them in international forums, especially when the polluters are violating a treaty. Cooperation could, therefore, emerge from efforts to link climate with other issues and to embed climate commitments in international law.","[Tingley, Dustin] Harvard Univ, Dept Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Tomz, Michael] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Harvard University; Stanford University,"Tingley, D (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Dept Govt, 1737 Cambridge St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",dtingley@gov.harvard.edu,,"Tomz, Michael/0000-0002-0453-024X",,,,,38,84,91,1,32,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0010-4140,1552-3829,,COMP POLIT STUD,Comp.

Therefore, it attracts much attention from the industrial sector, government authorities and scientific community. However, public awareness of the technology is extremely low, and the studies of the lay people's opinion have been launched only during the last decade. Taking into account the role of public support during the implementation of CCS projects, the authors would like to present herein their review of materials on this subject published during 2002-2018 (135 articles). As part of our review, we determined 9 key aspects forming the public perception of CCS. For each of the key aspects, we summarized the available results of the studies. Apart from that, we compared the CCS current status in different countries and provided a number of reasons for involving new countries into the fight against global warming. This work shows that most attention is devoted to CO2 storage; whereas its capture and transportation are poorly studied in terms of public perception. Wider development is required for the methodology enabling a transition from global rhetoric concerning global warming issues to the implementation of particular projects, namely, CCS. The issues related to public awareness of CCS are studied rather thoroughly, but no recommendations are provided regarding the establishment of an optimal database for the lay people. Numerous assessments of general public perception have been carried out. However little attention was paid to the regions with active projects, namely, to the factors considered the most important by the local public, and how actual project results meet their expectations. Therefore, despite an extensive scientific base developed over 17 years, further studies should be aimed at filling the existing gaps. This will enable to improve CCS attractiveness for the public, including the cases when it is compared with alternative low-carbon technologies.","[Tcvetkov, Pavel] St Petersburg Min Univ, Dept Informat & Comp Technol, 21st Line,2, St Petersburg, Vasilevskiy Isl, Russia; [Cherepovitsyn, Alexey] St Petersburg Min Univ, Dept Org & Management, 21st Line,2, St Petersburg, Vasilevskiy Isl, Russia; [Fedoseev, Sergey] Russian Acad Sci, Kola Sci Ctr, Subdiv Fed Res Ctr, Luzin Inst Econ Studies, Fersman St 24a, Apatity, Russia","Saint Petersburg Mining University; Saint Petersburg Mining University; Russian Academy of Sciences; Kola Science Centre of the Russian Academy of Sciences; Luzin Institute for Economic Studies, Kola Science Centre of the Russian Academy of Sciences","Tcvetkov, P (corresponding author), St Petersburg Min Univ, Dept Informat & Comp Technol, 21st Line,2, St Petersburg, Vasilevskiy Isl, Russia.",pscvetkov@yandex.ru,"Tcvetkov, Pavel/A-3106-2016; Fedoseev, Sergey Vladimirovich/O-2540-2016","Tcvetkov, Pavel/0000-0002-3049-7893; Sergey, Fedoseev/0000-0002-1224-2213",Russian Science Foundation [18-18-00210]; Saint-Petersburg Mining University; Russian Science Foundation [18-18-00210] Funding Source: Russian Science Foundation,Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)); Saint-Petersburg Mining University; Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)),"The research was carried out within research school Rational subsoil use in the Department of Organization and Management; with the financial support of the grant of the Russian Science Foundation (Project No. 18-18-00210, Development of assessment methodology of public efficiency of projects devoted to carbon dioxide sequestration).

We examine this question using a comprehensive index of public concern about climate change in each state from 1999 to 2017. The index aggregates data from over 400,000 survey respondents in 170 polls. These new estimates of state-level climate concern enable us to exploit geographic variation in locally experienced climate changes over an extended time period. We show that climate concern peaked in 2000 and again in 2017 and that climate concern is modestly responsive to changes in state-level temperatures. Overall, our results suggest that continued increases in temperature are likely to cause public concern about climate change to grow in the future. But a warming climate, on its own, is unlikely to yield a consensus in the mass public about the threat posed by climate change.","[Bergquist, Parrish] Yale Univ, Yale Program Climate Change Commun, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Warshaw, Christopher] George Washington Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Washington, DC 20052 USA",Yale University; George Washington University,"Bergquist, P (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Yale Program Climate Change Commun, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",parrish.bergquist@yale.edu; warshaw@gwu.edu,"Warshaw, Christopher/AAM-4838-2021",,MIT's Office of the Provost,MIT's Office of the Provost,This project was supported by a generous grant from MIT's Office of the Provost.,,20,83,93,10,66,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-3816,1468-2508,,J POLIT,J.

Following this recommendation, we report results from a study in Norway. McCright and Dunlap argue that climate change denial can be understood as an expression of protecting group identity and justifying a societal system that provides desired benefits. Our findings resemble those in the US study. A total of 63 per cent of conservative males in Norway do not believe in anthropogenic climate change, as opposed to 36 per cent among the rest of the population who deny climate change and global warming. Expanding on the US study, we investigate whether conservative males more often hold what we term xenosceptic views, and if that adds to the 'cool dude-effect'.(1) Multivariate logistic regression models reveal strong effects from a variable measuring 'xenosceptic cool dudes'. Interpreting xenoscepticism as a rough proxy for right leaning views, climate change denial in Norway seems to merge with broader patterns of right-wing nationalism.","[Krange, Olve] Norwegian Inst Nat Res NINA Oslo, Oslo, Norway; [Kaltenborn, Bjorn P.] Norwegian Inst Nat Res NINA Lillehammer, Lillehammer, Norway; [Hultman, Martin] Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Tema Technol & Social Change, Sweden & Human Geog, Gothenburg, Sweden",Norwegian Institute Nature Research; Norwegian Institute Nature Research; Chalmers University of Technology,"Krange, O (corresponding author), Norwegian Inst Nat Res NINA Oslo, Oslo, Norway.",olve.krange@nina.no,,"Hultman, Martin/0000-0001-9642-5895; Kaltenborn, Bjorn Petter/0000-0003-3735-4796",Research Council of Norway [160022/F40]; Norwegian institute for nature research,Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); Norwegian institute for nature research(Bioforsk),This work was supported by The Research Council of Norway [160022/F40]; Norwegian institute for nature research.,,63,83,87,3,48,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2325-1042,,,ENVIRON SOCIOL,Envir.

Given the systemic reach of much senior decision making, including decisions that constrain their own actions, there is an urgent need to open up the SDM black box. Focused on Western governments and multinational corporations, this article examines a cross-disciplinary range of literature to ask: What are the key factors affecting the preparedness of SDMsparticularly those who accept the climate scienceto take the decisive actions needed to drive rapid and significant emission reductions? The review brings together multiple perspectives on the many compounding factors operating across three interconnected scales: micro (individual and interpersonal factors including disciplinary background, worldview, gender, and risk perceptions); meso (network, organizational and institutional factors including management paradigms, organizational culture, and institutional complexity); and macro (environmental, social, cultural, political, and economic factors including climatic extremes, vested interests, and public opinion). It concludes that SDMs are strongly focused on their local' professional context and near-term pressures, including reputation among peers, relationships with competitors, and real-time financial status. As a group they exist within a largely closed circuit and perceive the world from a particular narrow perspective. Combined with the complexity and embedded character of existing systems, this occludes more systemic or reflexive thinking or action. This deep propensity for inaction suggests that a coordinated multi-frontal approach is essential for a new more effective mitigation approach.

However, this collective action is precluded by the 'consensus gap' between scientific knowledge and public opinion. Here, we test the extent to which the iconic cities around the world are likely to shift in response to climate change. By analyzing city pairs for 520 major cities of the world, we test if their climate in 2050 will resemble more closely to their own current climate conditions or to the current conditions of other cities in different bioclimatic regions. Even under an optimistic climate scenario (RCP 4.5), we found that 77% of future cities are very likely to experience a climate that is closer to that of another existing city than to its own current climate. In addition, 22% of cities will experience climate conditions that are not currently experienced by any existing major cities. As a general trend, we found that all the cities tend to shift towards the sub-tropics, with cities from the Northern hemisphere shifting to warmer conditions, on average similar to 1000 km south (velocity similar to 20 km. year(-1)), and cities from the tropics shifting to drier conditions. We notably predict that Madrid's climate in 2050 will resemble Marrakech's climate today, Stockholm will resemble Budapest, London to Barcelona, Moscow to Sofia, Seattle to San Francisco, Tokyo to Changsha. Our approach illustrates how complex climate data can be packaged to provide tangible information. The global assessment of city analogues can facilitate the understanding of climate change at a global level but also help land managers and city planners to visualize the climate futures of their respective cities, which can facilitate effective decision-making in response to on-going climate change.","[Bastin, Jean-Francois; Clark, Emily; Elliott, Thomas; van den Hoogen, Johan; Hordijk, Iris; Ma, Haozhi; Majumder, Sabiha; Maschler, Julia; Mo, Lidong; Routh, Devin; Yu, Kailiang; Zohner, Constantin M.; Crowther, Thomas W.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Integrat Biol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Crowther Lab, Zurich, Switzerland; [Hart, Simon] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Plant Ecol, Inst Integrat Biol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Manoli, Gabriele] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Engn, Dept Civil Environm & Geomat Engn, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Bastin, JF (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Integrat Biol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Crowther Lab, Zurich, Switzerland.",bastin.jf@gmail.com,"Manoli, Gabriele/JNS-4061-2023; crowther, thomas w/B-4807-2012; Ma, Haozhi/KCJ-5052-2024; Clark, Emily/GVR-7159-2022; Hart, Simon/AAT-8532-2020; Hart, Simon/B-6492-2013","Manoli, Gabriele/0000-0002-9245-2877; Ma, Haozhi/0000-0003-0709-1438; Crowther, Thomas/0000-0001-5674-8913; , Iris/0000-0002-6302-6254; Hart, Simon/0000-0001-7957-8689; van den Hoogen, Johan/0000-0001-6624-8461; Zohner, Constantin/0000-0002-8302-4854; Bastin, Jean-Francois/0000-0003-2602-7247; Routh, Devin/0000-0002-5910-8847",DOB Ecology; Plant-for-the-Planet; German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development,DOB Ecology; Plant-for-the-Planet; German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development,"Author TWC is supported by grant from DOB Ecology.

A survey question wording experiment with a nationally representative U.S. sample is utilized. We find framing effects only among Republicans, whose policy support was lower in response to the climate change frame versus the air pollution and energy security frames for all policies except nuclear power. This suggests that framing effects are conditional on political partisanship and policy content. When testing the processing mechanism behind these effects, we find no evidence that the climate change frame functions as a simple heuristic; rather, the findings are consistent with motivated reasoning, whereby the framing effects on policy support are mediated by the policy's perceived relative benefits and costs.","[Feldman, Lauren] Rutgers State Univ, Sch Commun & Informat, 4 Huntington St, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Hart, P.

Our results contribute to the existing literatures on public perceptions of policy experts, framing, and cultural theory. We find that individuals evaluate expert credibility based on the way in which experts frame issues, and on the congruity/dissonance between these expert communication frames and one's underlying worldview. However, we also identify limits to these framing effects.

The aim is to create knowledge for the design and implementatioh of policy measures. The results of an opinion poll conducted in 2005 and 2010 are compared. The number of respondents favouring new technologies as a way to reduce emissions was substantially lower in 2010 than in 2005, whereas there was an increase in the number of people who acknowledged that lifestyle changes are necessary to counteract climate changes. This indicates. an increased awareness among the public of the need for lifestyle changes, which could facilitate implementation of policies promoting environmental behaviour. Renewable energy and energy saving measures were ranked as the top two measures for mitigating climate change in both polls. In determining which energy behaviours of the public are determined by psychological factors, an analysis of the 2010 survey revealed that respondents with pro-environmental attitudes towards global warming favour significantly increased use of renewable energy technologies and greater engagement in energy-efficient behaviours.

In particular, debates about economic benefits, energy security and environmental impact have been provoked by the proposed Keystone XL pipeline expansion intended to take bitumen from northern Alberta in Canada to refineries on the Gulf Coast in Texas. Drawing on data from recent surveys conducted by the Pew Research Center, this article asks a series of questions. What levels of support for (and opposition to) the pipeline exist among the American public? What are the roles of political factors (such as party identification and ideology), economic attitudes, environmental attitudes and proximity to the proposed pipeline route in shaping attitudes toward the pipeline? And how do political factors and proximity to the pipeline interact? We find that partisanship and ideology drive attitudes toward the Keystone XL pipeline, and that the effect of ideology is attenuated by proximity to the proposed route.

In opposition the 'Vote Blue, Go Green' strategy had a positive impact on the party's image: the environment operated as a valence issue in a period of raised public concern, particularly about climate change, and Cameron's high-profile support contributed to the cross-party consensus that delivered radical change in climate policy. Although the Coalition government has implemented important environmental measures, the Conservatives have not enhanced their green credentials in government and Cameron has failed to provide strong leadership on the issue. Since 2010, climate change has to some extent been transformed into a positional issue. Conservative MPs, urged on by the right-wing press, have adopted an increasingly partisan approach to climate change, and opinion polls reveal clear partisan divisions on climate change amongst public opinion. As a positional issue climate change has become challenging for the Conservatives, showing them to be internally divided, rebellious and inclined to support producer interests. This article makes a contribution to our understanding of Conservative modernization, while also challenging the dominant assumption in the scholarly literature that the environment, particularly climate change, is a valence issue.","[Carter, Neil] Univ York, Dept Polit, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Clements, Ben] Univ Leicester, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England",University of York - UK; University of Leicester,"Carter, N (corresponding author), Univ York, Dept Polit, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",neil.carter@york.ac.uk; bc101@leicester.ac.uk,,"Carter, Neil Thomas/0000-0003-3378-8773; Clements, Ben/0000-0002-1024-2543",ESRC [ES/K00042X/1]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K00042X/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),The author would like to acknowledge that some of the material used in this article was gathered for the ESRC funded project 'Climate Policy and Political Parties' (ES/K00042X/1).,,58,81,86,0,31,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",1746-918X,1746-9198,,BRIT POLIT,Br.

Scientists and policy advisors are more likely than the public to express a belief in the existence and anthropogenic nature of global warming. We also find ideological polarization about global warming in all three groups, although scientists are less polarized than the public and policy advisors over whether global warming is actually occurring. Alarmingly, there is evidence that the ideological divide about global warming gets significantly larger according to respondents' knowledge about politics, energy, and science.","[Bolsen, Toby] Georgia State Univ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Druckman, James N.] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Druckman, James N.] Northwestern Univ, Inst Policy Res, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Cook, Fay Lomax] Natl Sci Fdn, Arlington, VA 22230 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; Northwestern University; Northwestern University; National Science Foundation (NSF),"Bolsen, T (corresponding author), Georgia State Univ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",,,,Initiative for Sustainability and Energy at Northwestern,Initiative for Sustainability and Energy at Northwestern,The authors thank Elizabeth Karampelas and Adnan Rasool for research assistance.

Through analysis of telephone survey responses, we explore support for natural gas drilling in residents of Washington County (WC), PA (n=502) vs. residents of Allegheny County (AC), PA (n=799). WC has had intense Marcellus Shale (MS) drilling activity, in comparison to adjacent AC, which has had little drilling activity. WC residents are marginally more supportive of MS drilling than are AC residents (p=0.0768). Residents of WC are more likely to perceive MS as an economic opportunity than are AC residents (p=0.0015); to be in a family that has signed a MS lease (p < 0.0001); to follow the MS issue closely (p = 0.0003); to get MS information from neighbors, friends, and relatives (p < 0.0001); and are marginally less likely to perceive MS as an environmental threat (p = 0.1090). WC leaseholders are significantly more supportive of MS drilling than WC non-leaseholders and AC non-leaseholders (p = 0.0024). Mediation analyses show that county-based differences in support of MS drilling are due to WC residents seeing more of an economic opportunity in the MS and their greater likelihood of having a family-held lease.

Spearheaded as a movement based on ethical principles, divestment has been suggested to play a potential role in shaping public opinion and policymaking on climate change. The growing size of the movement has prompted debate about the extent of its impact on fossil fuel companies and climate change mitigation efforts. This article investigates the potential effectiveness of the divestment movement according to the end goal of climate campaigners - to bring about a complete break from fossil fuels. We collect and qualify the key arguments as found mainly in the informal debate, and to a lesser extent in the academic literature. This will help readers to make an informed judgement that can contribute to a constructive debate about the effectiveness of divestment. We organize the literature into arguments for and against divestment, and explain how these relate to each other. In addition, we derive suggestions for further research on divestment.","[Braungardt, Sibylle] Karlsruhe & Oko Inst eV, Fraunhofer Inst Syst & Innovat Res ISI, Merzhauser Str 173, D-79100 Freiburg, Germany; [van den Bergh, Jeroen] ICREA, Barcelona, Spain; [van den Bergh, Jeroen; Dunlop, Tessa] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Environm Sci & Technol, Bellaterra, Spain; [van den Bergh, Jeroen] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Sch Business & Econ, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van den Bergh, Jeroen] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Fraunhofer Gesellschaft; ICREA; Autonomous University of Barcelona; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"van den Bergh, J (corresponding author), Oko Inst eV, Merzhauser Str 173, D-79100 Freiburg, Germany.",S.Braungardt@oeko.de; jeroen.bergh@uab.es,,"Braungardt, Sibylle/0000-0002-2966-7656","Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities, through the Maria de Maeztu program for Units of Excellence [MDM-2015-0552]; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union [741087]","Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities, through the Maria de Maeztu program for Units of Excellence(Spanish Government); European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC))","Van den Bergh received financial support from the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities, through the Maria de Maeztu program for Units of Excellence (MDM-2015-0552), and from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme through an ERC Advanced Grant (grant agreement no 741087).",,95,75,79,4,58,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2214-6296,2214-6326,,ENERGY RES SOC SCI,Energy Res.

Recent change in public opinion has been caused by the physical signs of climate change-melting glaciers, rising sea levels, more severe storm and drought events, and hotter average global temperatures annually. Transportation is a major contributor of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gas emissions from human activity, accounting for approximately 14 percent of total anthropogenic emissions globally and about 27 percent in the U.S. Fortunately, transportation technologies and strategies are emerging that can help to meet the climate challenge. These include automotive and fuel technologies, intelligent transportation systems (ITS), and mobility management strategies that can reduce the demand for private vehicles. While the climate change benefits of innovative engine and vehicle technologies are relatively well understood, there are fewer studies available on the energy and emission impacts of ITS and mobility management strategies. In the future, ITS and mobility management will likely play a greater role in reducing fuel consumption. Studies are often based on simulation models, scenario analysis, and limited deployment experience. Thus, more research is needed to quantify potential impacts. Of the nine ITS technologies examined, traffic signal control, electronic toll collection, bus rapid transit, and traveler information have been deployed more widely and demonstrated positive impacts (but often on a limited basis). Mobility management approaches that have established the greatest CO2 reduction potential, to date, include road pricing policies (congestion and cordon) and carsharing (shortterm auto access). Other approaches have also indicated CO2 reduction potential including: low-speed modes, integrated regional smart cards, park-and-ride facilities, parking cash out, smart growth, telecommuting, and carpooling.","[Shaheen, Susan] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Shaheen, Susan] Univ Calif Berkeley, California Path, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Lipman, Timothy] Univ Calif Berkeley, Transportat Sustainabil Res Ctr, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Shaheen, SA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",,,,"University of California, Davis","University of California, Davis(University of California System)","The authors would like to thank the Honda Endowment for New Mobility Studies at the University of California, Davis for generously funding this research.

This study examines the PCFs affecting consumers' intention to purchase RGTs (IPR) in a hybrid behavioral framework. For this purpose, this study has developed a hybrid behavioral framework through the introduction of components of PCFs including the perceived benefit component of RGTs (BC), perceived cost component of RGTs (CC), perceived investment risk component of RGTs (IRC), and green solution to power blackout (GSPB) to a comprehensive framework. The analysis has been conducted on data collected through a questionnaire survey from rural and urban regions of Punjab province of Pakistan. The results are categorized into three types of components. First, the perceived functional component (FC), perceived conditional component (CDC), BC, and GSPB are termed 'driving components,' likely to drive consumers' IPR positively. Second, the 'inhibitory components' are composed of CC and IRC, which are likely to inhibit consumers' IPR. For these two types of components, the results were robust across all the samples. Third, the perceived social component (SOC) and perceived emotional component (EMC) are known as 'neutrality components,' likely to impart no effect on consumers' IPR in the case of the whole sample and urban regions. However, in the case of rural areas, they proved to be 'driving components.' Thus, firstly, rural-urban heterogeneity is found in terms of SOC and EMC's heterogeneous effects across rural and urban regions. Secondly, the size of all the components' effect remained relatively larger in urban regions than in the rural regions. Based on the results, novel policy implications are proposed.

Party is commonly defined by three groups: Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. Here, using statewide New Hampshire survey data, we elaborate this approach to distinguish a fourth group: respondents who say they support the Tea Party movement. On 8 out of 12 science- or environment-related questions, Tea Party supporters differ significantly from non-Tea Party Republicans. Tea Party supporters are less likely than non-Tea Party Republicans to trust scientists for information about environmental issues, accept human evolution, believe either the physical reality or the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change, or recognise trends in Arctic ice, glaciers, or CO2. Despite factual gaps, Tea Party supporters express greater confidence in their own understanding of climate change. Independents, on the other hand, differ less from non-Tea Party Republicans on most of these questionsalthough Independents do more often accept the scientific consensus on climate change. On many science and environmental questions, Republicans and Tea Party supporters stand farther apart than Republicans and Independents.","[Hamilton, Lawrence C.; Saito, Kei] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Sociol, Durham, NH 03824 USA",University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire,"Hamilton, LC (corresponding author), Univ New Hampshire, Dept Sociol, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",Lawrence.Hamilton@unh.edu,,,National Science Foundation (New Hampshire EPSCoR) [EPS-1101245]; National Science Foundation (PoLAR Climate Change Education Partnership) [DUE-1239783]; National Science Foundation (Sea Ice Prediction Network) [PLR-1303938]; Carsey School and Sustainability Institute at the University of New Hampshire; Division Of Undergraduate Education; Direct For Education and Human Resources [1239783] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; EPSCoR; Office Of The Director [1101245] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation (New Hampshire EPSCoR)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Science Foundation (PoLAR Climate Change Education Partnership); National Science Foundation (Sea Ice Prediction Network); Carsey School and Sustainability Institute at the University of New Hampshire; Division Of Undergraduate Education; Direct For Education and Human Resources(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU)); EPSCoR; Office Of The Director(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)NSF - Office of Integrative Activities (OIA)),"Environmental questions on the Granite State Poll are supported by grants from the National Science Foundation (New Hampshire EPSCoR EPS-1101245, PoLAR Climate Change Education Partnership DUE-1239783, Sea Ice Prediction Network PLR-1303938), and by the Carsey School and Sustainability Institute at the University of New Hampshire.

Wind energy can provide carbon-free electricity generation, so within societal discourse on how society should minimize the risks of climate change it is widely recognized and acknowledged as a valuable technology. Despite recent increases in wind turbine installation in the USA, the high-level of variation in deployment patterns of wind technology in different states cannot be explained simply by wind resource patterns. Other factors, including differences in the state-level, socio-political context, seem to be influencing wind development. This research compares these contextual differences by using media analysis to assess state-level public discourse about wind technology. Through comparative content and frame analysis of newspaper coverage of wind power in Texas, Minnesota, and Massachusetts, we explore state-level variations in the salience of wind in public discourse, the focus on wind power as a climate change mitigating technology, and the framing of wind power's risks and benefits. In addition to identifying distinct state-level variation in wind energy discourse, the results demonstrate that wind's climate change mitigation potential has been a limited but growing part of media coverage on wind power.","[Stephens, Jennie C.; Rand, Gabriel M.; Melnick, Leah L.] Clark Univ, Dept Int Dev Community & Environm, Environm Sci & Policy Program, Worcester, MA 01610 USA; [Stephens, Jennie C.] Harvard Univ, Kennedy Sch, Energy Technol Innovat Policy Grp, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Clark University; Harvard University,"Stephens, JC (corresponding author), Clark Univ, Dept Int Dev Community & Environm, Environm Sci & Policy Program, 950 Main St, Worcester, MA 01610 USA.",jstephens@clarku.edu,,,,,,,73,73,88,0,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1752-4032,1752-4040,,ENVIRON COMMUN,Environ.
